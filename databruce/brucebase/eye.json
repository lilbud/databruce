Of course I couldn't provide any kind of set list because at that time I had never heard any of his music. In fact, I was totally unaware of him until the fall of 1971. I was a college student at a small school in Kansas and I met a fellow longhair (Kevin Gray) from Richmond who spent 6 months raving about how great Bruce was. Of course I thought Kevin was full of s**t, Bruce's name was completely unknown in my part of the world (and remained that way until Greetings\u2026 was released). No way anybody that under-the-radar could be as incredible as Kevin claimed, so that's why we hitched back to his hometown on spring break, even though we didn't know whether or not he'd be playing while we were there. The gods smiled on us, fortunately\u2026 The only cover song they performed that I recognized was \"Not Fade Away\", a Stones-like version, if memory serves. And, yeah, the BSB lived up to Kevin's non-stop hype, I've always let him know how forever indebted I am for giving me the 'advance notice.' I 'm pretty certain my does not have anything from that specific show. He usually carried his camera everywhere but for some unknown reason he didn't have it with him that night. The reason he was able to pinpoint the date was because the day after that we went up to Maryland and saw the <a href=\"https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/the-beach-boys/1972/university-of-maryland-college-park-md-3bdb1ccc.html\" target=\"_blank\">Beach Boys at the University of Maryland</a>, and that date is documented on a Beach Boys concert website. I knew we had seen Bruce before the Beach Boys show, I just didn't remember it being one day before, although I did know for certain that the Back Door performance was NOT on the weekend. It Wasn't until the Born To Run tour in '75 that I got to see him live again, and he crawled off the stage and into my lap during the breakdown part of Spirit In The Night, so that made the 2nd 'never will forget' Springsteen memory in my lifetime.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

That night on Saturday, November 11, 1972 we headed back to campus, where the action was. We had a choice of a free concert or take in a basketball game. We decided to check out the concert thinking that\u2019s where most of the campus crowd would be. To our surprise, the concert was all but empty, with students preferring to attend the basketball game, rather than attending the concert of a relatively unknown rocker. So after a song or two, we also headed to the game, unknown to us that we had the opportunity to attend the concert of a future legend. The story I enjoy telling about seeing Springsteen was I once saw him for free and didn\u2019t stay for the whole performance. Thanks for letting me share this unbelievable memory.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I remember some of their early songs and I also remember \"Devil With The Blue Dress On\". I think they played \"Come Together\" by the Beatles too. When it was over, we were exhausted. I went to breakfast late that night at a diner and there they were. I said hello, told them how great the show was and made small talk. Bruce could not have been nicer. Clarence too.

Bruce was in his traditional black turtleneck sweater and grey tweed newsboy cap. I remember Albany Al coming on stage to join the band for E Street Shuffle, I guess. Bruce told a story about signing with Colombia. \u2018Everything was white and gold\u2019 as he took the elevator up to the Columbia offices. I don\u2019t remember what song followed. I do remember David strumming the piano strings for Serenade, like on the album. My friend kept calling out for \u2018Thundercrack\u2019 (he was hard to miss sitting right under Bruce). He had heard the song at MSG that summer and kept raving to me about it. I am pretty sure they played it. At one point Bruce broke his pick and asked if anyone in the audience had an extra. I had one in my back pocket and handed it up to him. \u2018Nah, too big\u2019, as he handed it back to me. Of course, I held onto it all these years! (see Memorabilia-tab).

Hence, the Bristol Police Dept. enforced the town curfew, making for the 100 minute show.<br/>\nBruce and the band arrived early but their equipment manager quit, they had to find another. (apparently this new guy was Butch). The concert coordinator for Roger Williams College received a call from Butch saying he was on the Tappen Zee bridge in NY at 6:25pm with a flat tire. Another band opened the show at 9. After a very long wait and with no explanations at all to the crowd (less than 100 people) Bruce, apologizing for a bunch of mess ups, finally took the stage at 12:35am. He played Walking The Dog (cover of the Rufus Thomas song), Kitty\u2019s Back and Rosalita. He stretched out each song because he and the band were informed the town curfew was 1am (the show was a lot shorter than a previously reported 100 minutes. Just after 1am the power to the room was cut off, bringing the show to a close).

Please bear in mind that all I had to go on was the Cover of Wild &amp; Innocent. So I was unsure of who was in the band until others confirmed the dates of the band change. Also, as background, I was in NYC for my father's second wedding, so you might imagine there was a fair amount of confusion and emotional storms going on. Leaving that aside, I arrived a couple of days before the show (Rehearsal dinner, etc.). I saw in the paper that Bruce was playing Central Park. My younger sister Catherine who was also attending also wanted to go. This is the main reason I hadn't brought a tape recorder. As it was I remember a fair amount of security so it wouldn't have worked anyway. So after putting in an appearance at the wedding reception, My sister and I made our inconspicuous exit. I think we walked to the park, where there was a long line to get in. I barely remember Brewer &amp; Shipley, but I was riveted once Bruce came on. I didn't keep a setlist during the show, but did write one down from memory when I got back to Michigan. I can't promise it's completely accurate, but there's more than is currently in BruceBase.</p>\n<p>INCIDENT ON 52nd STREET / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT /DOES THIS BUS STOP AT 82nd / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY / JUNGLELAND / KITTY'S BACK / ROSALITA (COME OUT TONIGHT).</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Performance notes</span>: Incident started very softly with David Sancious playing the intro. Bruce came on and did what I can only call an interpretive dance acting out the various parts and actions in the song. The other band members came in one-by-one (including Suki Lahav, I think) until it ended at full volume. Jungleland was of course a new song, and the version he did had the \"Hungry and Hunted\" portion of the song as a repeated chorus, which I noted in my setlist. I think a version from the Bottom Line also had this version. He dedicated \"Kitty's Back\" to a topless dancer and the Sportsmans Club in NJ (Bruce does love his topless dancers). One of the things that divided my attention was watching my younger sister. So when he started \"Rosalita\" everyone stood and rushed the stage. I wanted to but didn't want to lose track of my sister. When I looked for her she was way ahead of me crowding the stage. I was worried about staying out too late and possibly missing connections with my father, So I decided to leave after Springsteen's set with the slight worry about walking through Central Park after dark. However it soon became clear that nearly everyone was leaving so there was safety in the crowd from my NYC paranoia. Anyway when I got back home I wrote down a list of the songs I remembered him doing.

Bruce came on and sang \"Incident on 57 street\" archipelago for the first few minutes, just him, with one spot light on him. Man it was powerful. They Rocked! I remember a few of the songs that they played \"E street\", \"Sandy\", \"New York Serenade\" (was incredible, with I found out later, David Sancious) and \"Rosilita\". I know he played some from Asbury Park but it's a bit more iffy, \"Growin Up\". Anyway next day I bought \"Wild, Innocent &amp; E Street Shuffle\", And \"Greetings from Asbury Park\". There was no \"Born To Run\" yet. I was hooked and spread the news far and wide. told my friends at upstate colleges to catch him. Became the piped piper of Bruce.

We went over earlier before the show and walked backstage and talk to Bruce for what seemed like hours. I remember thinking, wow, this is the nicest guy but he really can\u2019t grow a beard! Pretty scruffy looking for a performer. Later when the show started and we had seats up close to the front, Bruce came out and dedicated a song to \u201cBushman\u201d (that was the nickname of my friend Jeff Bosch).

A month later I saw Bruce on October 18, 1974 at The Capitol Theater in Passaic, New Jersey (as a bus trip sponsored by a local college). There were 3 acts on the bill. They were Dan Fogelberg, Bruce &amp; headliner John Sebastian (of The Lovin Spoonful fame). Years later I confirmed the rumored story with John Sebastian himself that he heard Bruce's rehearsal and said there was no way that he was going to follow Bruce on stage; so Bruce closed the show. It was by far the most intense concert I have ever seen in my life. The mixture of Bruce's voice and Suki Lahav's violin playing were magical. Hearing new material from what would become an lp called \"Born to Run\" was also a treat. This new song called \"Jungleland\" was especially moving and powerful and unlike any other Bruce song. I was a fairly reserved person back then but I remember dancing in the aisle with a few thousand of my closest friends. It was much more than a concert for sure.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Everything was sort of on the fly. Mike Appel would just get gigs even as we traveled around. Gigs like Liberty Hall (Houston) and others were booked from Appel\u2019s hotel room while were doing a show in New Orleans or Atlanta or Nashville. More than once I would be in Appel\u2019s hotel room asking where we were going \u201cnext\u201d and he\u2019d just say \u201cI\u2019m working on it\u201d. So Appel sometimes didn\u2019t know what we were going to\u2014what the actual venue was. Sometimes we didn\u2019t know how many shows. Liberty Hall was one of them. It was kind of a very cool place\u2014part concert hall\u2014part nightclub with tables. We were originally only supposed to be there for one show but things were (always) \u201cflexible\u201d. We ended up there for about four nights simply because the reception for Bruce was good and we had no real plan.</p>\n<p>So anyway, we\u2019re in Texas and Appel books a show in Dallas. I think it was supposed to be after the Armadillo World Headquarters shows. Jeff Hall and myself manage to find this place. It was a rusted out corrugated tin building out on the prairie\u2014there was nothing but prairie\u2014just empty prairie way outside of Dallas. Jeff and I just looked at each and were like\u2014'this doesn\u2019t look good\u2019. We go inside and it\u2019s a BOXING RING. There are no people there for sound\u2014or lights. The only thing we see are the boxing announcer horns above the ring and the building\u2019s hanging flood lights and the seating was just benches on all four sides. The place smelled of sweat and urine and was filthy. Jeff and I really have doubts about unloading the band gear\u2014and we had no idea which way to face the gear for any sort of show. So we start looking for someone to talk to. There were some locker rooms and we finally found an office\u2014and inside the office was the \u201cpromoter\u201d\u2014who was busy cooking drugs (heroin) in a spoon. Yeah\u2014that was a shocker even to us. So we ask him if he knows about the show and this guy says \u201cI\u2019m the promoter\u2014but I need a little privacy\u2014I\u2019ll be with you in a little while\u201d.</p>\n<p>Jeff and I both decided we weren\u2019t unloading any band gear.</p>\n<p>And shortly after that, Appel arrives\u2014followed by the band (in another station wagon). We tell Appel what the story is and he decides to take a look. Meanwhile Bruce gets out of the wagon takes a look at this decrepit corrugated tin building surrounded by deserted prairie and says \u201cI\u2019m not playing here\u201d<br/>\nAnd that was it\u2014decision made.</p>\n<p>We went back towards the actual city of Dallas to some rooms (Holiday Inn I think) and Appel got on the phone to find us another gig in Dallas. He did. It was some sort of strip club and we actually did do a show there to a massive crowd of about 5 strippers and a few drunks at the bar and maybe about 8 or 10 other people (the strippers loved the show) . But it was still a lot nicer than the \u2018boxing ring\u2019.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

This concert was held in the small gymnasium which was affectionately nicknamed \"The Barn\". Just before the concert began my friends and myself decided to walk over to the men's locker room that Billy was using as a dressing room to try and snap a few pictures as he emerged to go onstage. The quickest way to get there was to walk underneath the bleachers that were on the side of the gym. I remember seeing the outline of a scruffy guy sitting huddled up with his back against the wall under the bleachers. I thought it quite odd and that perhaps this guy must be either stoned or drunk since the show was about to begin in minutes and here he was sitting with his back up against the wall in the darkness. During the excellent show Billy paused and dedicated the song \"The Entertainer\" to his friend and fellow Columbia Recording Artist in the audience - BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN. You could see the Bruce fans scanning the audience looking for that beanie that he used to wear. No luck. For the third encore Billy invited Bruce onstage to perform an impromptu version of \"Twist &amp; Shout\". I can remember the feeling of seeing these two performers together on stage knowing that they were both destined to become superstars. (It did not strike me until the next day that the scruffy guy huddled in the shadows under the bleachers; that I was inches away from me was in fact Bruce who was trying to keep low key).</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

John Kostick, a rep from CBS Records, played me an advance copy of \"Born To Run\", and it was obvious that it was going to be a huge hit. I booked a show with Bruce at the Syria Mosque in early 1975, and in no time we had a sellout. The concert was fabulous; everything I had heard about Bruce as a performer was true. He commanded the stage and drove the fans into a frenzy. They were singing along to even the most obscure Springsteen songs, and it was obvious a star was being born. Every now and then, an act comes along that just has it all. Bruce was one of those. John Kostick asked if Cindy and I would like to join him and Bruce for a bite to eat after the concert. They were headed to Cleveland for another show. I called Carmassi's, an Italian restaurant we went to on occasion, to make sure it was going to be open late. The owner, Sonny Carmassi, assured me we could dine there. When the four of us arrived, the door was locked. I knocked, Sonny came out, looked at us, and pulled me inside the restaurant. \"Listen Rich, I can let the three of you in but not that other guy. He's not dressed properly.\" Bruce was wearing a wife beater, jeans, and sandals. \"What do you mean? Do you know who that is? That's Bruce Springsteen!\" \"Who's Bruce Springsteen? I don't care who he is, he can't come in the restaurant dressed like that.\" After much pleading, Sonny let us in. I told him that after we ate he should frame Bruce's place setting, put it on the wall and people would come in just to look at it. Sonny didn't believe that Bruce would be a superstar, however, we were able to have dinner. The waiter came and took our orders. Bruce had the most unusual order\u2026corn on the cob for dinner and then later, apple pie. Shortly after that, Bruce's picture was on the cover of <em>Newsweek</em> and <em>Time</em> magazines. I called Sonny to be sure he kept the place setting, but he hadn't. He never realized how big a star had dined in his restaurant.

I am a big Bruce Springsteen fan, having seen him perform at least 6 or 7 times in the 70s and 80s. I recently Googled \u201cHow much is a 1975 Bruce Springsteen Paramount NW Concert poster worth\u201d and came across the entry for that concert on the Brucebase Wiki. I had to laugh at the comment regarding \u201ca partial audience recording that cuts in during \u201cBackstreets\u2019\u201d\u2026 because I was there and helped make that recording! Back in 1975, I had a military buddy (Stan Gutoski (RIP)), who had an extra ticket and wanted to know if I would help him record the show. We had heard of Bruce and read all the hype, but we still only knew that he had written \u201cBlinded by the Light\u201d and we had heard \u201cBorn to Run\u201d on the radio. We wanted to see what he was all about! He and I had recorded many rock concerts prior to this show, using a reel-to-reel recorder and a Nacamichi mic, but this night my friend had just gotten an new Sony Cassette Deck and wanted to use it. We got to the Paramount early and stood in line\u2026 I remember only 10 people ahead of us\u2026 and we were able to get front row seats. However, we were pushed back 4 rows because the front was reserved for the press. The seats we ended up with at the balcony were still great, with a bank of speakers directly in front of us. Unfortunately, we weren\u2019t familiar with the record and volume controls on the new Sony deck. The show started and we began recording. When it was time to put in a new cassette (we only used 1 side when recording to allow for time tracking) we went to swap tapes and realized that we hadn\u2019t taken the original off pause! We always said there was a million ways to screw up a recording! So, unfortunately, we missed the first half of the show, and only started recording midway through \u201cBackstreets.\u201d</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

It was also the first time I'd heard Bruce play \"It's My Life\", \"<a href=\"/song:raise-your-hand\">Raise Your Hand</a>\", and the brand new \"Frankie\", which featured Bruce on cowbell and pointed in a songwriting direction away from the sound of 'Born To Run'. \"It's My Life\" was stunning, virtually unrecognizable until the chorus, and prompting a standing ovation midway through the song as the band completed the first chorus. Despite Bruce saying on the 2016 River tour that \"Independence Day\" was his first song about fathers and sons (and what about \"Adam Raised A Cain\"?), clearly the spoken beginning of \"It's My Life\" is where he first visited this theme.

I am writing this just after Clarence's passing - it's both comforting and sad to reminisce. Thanks for the space.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

The band doesn\u2019t even need to show up for it to be a great day! Bands routinely comment that performing at Red Rocks is on their bucket list. So, of course I said yes. And was blown away and became a lifetime convert on the spot. Instantly my favorite performer, and this against the backdrop of living in SoCal in my late teens and seeing Jimi, Janis, Jim, Jerry and all the rest live in small venues. But Bruce of course was on another level. Red Rocks holds about 12,000 and it was not a sold out show, maybe 7 or 8 thousand that day. Didn\u2019t matter, folks went nuts. Kept pulling the band out for extra encores (just like everywhere), and finally at the very end he does I Fought The Law.

I swear they were songs we didn't know, had never heard, but were soon thereafter, on The River, songs like Point Blank, Independence Day come to mind. Can't remember the other 2. My friend and I told everybody about it\u2026 nobody believed us. You might not either, but I don't care, because I lived it.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

We had to wait three months because the original date of Mid may had been cancelled and rescheduled. It was definitely worth the wait. Myself and 15 other buddies walked to our front row seats at about 5 minutes before showtime like we were the mayors of the city. From the thunderous opening of Badlands to the rip roaring and rocking Quarter to Three we were all witnessing something special something cool, something amazing and we were totally blown away. Bruce was at times three feet in front of us on a stepdown stage whaling on his guitar at one time and then standing back to back with Clarence who was delivering his own magic on the saxophone. Bruce was lying on his back on the piano during one tune and someone behind us threw a rose up at him and it landed right on his chest. He picked it up, looked at it and smiled surprisingly then jumped off the piano with it and threw it back into the crowd and continued to rock the house. I have seen Bruce and the ESB 10 times. They have all been special and wonderful in their own way. But there is nothing like your first time seeing this great musician and his great band. Thanks for the wonderful memories.

And of those shows, the December 15, 1978 performance at the Wintergarden, San Francisco (broadcast on radio and bootlegged on CD as 'Live in the Promised Land') is usually considered the best among fans. But not by me. I wasn't there, but I've listened to it, and it's always sounded thin to me, with Max's drums especially sounding weak; the show couldn't actually have sounded like that. Nevertheless, Winterland doesn't measure up to what I think is the best show of the Darkness tour: September 19, 1978 at the Capitol Theatre in Passaic, New Jersey. It too was broadcast and bootlegged on CD ('Piece de Resistance'), and it sounds tremendous: a booming, thunderous performance played to a diamond-hard precision, with every instrument mixed and balanced perfectly. It sounds exactly like the show sounded: when Bruce's guitar rips into the 'Prove it All Night' solo, it sounds like a buzzsaw's berserk drone; when Clarence blows the first note of any solo, the crowd roars like when a baseball player hits a home run. I know, because I was there. It was only the third time I had ever seen Bruce (my first being his headlining debut at Madison Square Garden on August 21, followed by Springfield, Mass. on 9/13), but it's the closest I've ever been (6th row center). The show was the first of a three night stand, considered a 'homecoming' by the Capitol Theatre's owner, John Scher, following Bruce's summer-long country-wide Darkness tour. He wanted to make it special, and had the Capitol marquee illustrated to mark the event; I was the lucky artist commissioned to do it (I had met Ken Viola, the creator and publisher of the first Bruce magazine, Thunder Road, at the beginning of the summer; he's head of security for Scher, and recommended me for the job). I negotiated a special fee for the illustration: 6 sixth-row seats for myself and my friends. We all saw the show of our lives. Though the entire Darkness tour was brilliant, and Bruce and the E Streeters have always seemed to play an impossible level tighter for radio broadcasts (1975's 'The Saint, The Incident and the Main Point Shuffle' and Stockholm '88 are my two favorites), this Capitol Theatre show still stands above the rest, because at least 5 songs stand out as definitive live versions of not only the Darkness tour, but of Bruce's career: Promised Land, Prove it All Night, the extended Backstreets with the 'Sad Eyes' interlude, Because the Night, and She's the One (with the 'Not Fade Away' prelude). Listen to how full the band sounds when it kicks into the main theme of 'Promised Land' after Bruce's harmonica intro; or how Garry's bass parries Clarence's sax in the solo. Max's machine gun drumming at the end of 'Prove it\u2026,' Roy's jazzy piano at the beginning. The seamless transition from 'Not Fade Away' \u2014 with Bruce singing like Elvis on alternate lines \u2014 to 'She's the One' and Steven's tasty rhythm guitar licks up front in the mix; Bruce's screaming, wrenching guitar solos on the aforementioned 'Prove it\u2026,' 'Because the Night' and 'Backstreets.' Ah, 'Backstreets.' While I'm also partial to the version played at Jacksonville, Florida in '77 (with the monumental 'You lied!!!'), once again, Capitol Theatre is my desert island 'Backstreets.' This version of the 'Sad Eyes' interlude sounds the most like spoken-word poetry/performance art to me; you can really hear Bruce's measured breathing syncopating with Roy's music-box piano. The buildup of 'Little girl we've got to stop' to its crashing crescendo sounds as awesome as it was to behold: the stage going pitch black (Marc Brickman's lighting) on Bruce's final 'Stop!,' the crowd hushed and then exploding a moment later, as the band begins to reassemble, individual spotlights fading in until the white light finale of the 'Backstreets' theme recapitulation, leading to Bruce's closing wordless howls \u2014 some of his best ever \u2014 over a most orchestral grandeur. Winterland's 'Backstreets' compared to this? To this day, I have yet to hear any Darkness show that can hold a candle to this Capitol Theatre show, song for song, note for note. It's perfect. It's Bruce's de facto live album.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Greg Arnold</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Arlen, I have a copy of your artwork from this show hanging in my home!

I knew it was going to be broadcast live on WNEW, and I thought I had tickets for the show on the 20th. So I figured I'd fire up the tape deck (and a doobie or 2) listen to the show, and get ready for the next night. My friend who got the tickets shows up at my apartment on the 19th saying \"let's go\"! So, off we went to Passaic. What a freakin' night! One of the more amazing things about the show was that after they played Detroit Medley, the house lights went up, and the side doors to the Capitol opened up, and people started leaving. Then off wen the lights, the doors closed, and they came out for Raise Your Hand. As great as the show was, I was bummed that I didn't get the chance to tape it. Prayers were answered when my brother gave me the show on cassette for my b'day a month later.

I had been to a few shows on the \"Darkness\" tour and had been to Madison Square Garden a month earlier in August. I guess when I heard that it was going to be on WNEW-FM, I just decided to stay home and record it. I had been to Capitol a bunch of times and some friends were going, but I needed to get it onto a cassette tape so that I could capture what we knew would be a killer show. It really was a \"Piece de Resistance!\" For many years, I have told this story and will now tell it one more time - for the disciples out there who would understand what it means to reach the promised land. If I was not a the show, where was I? I had just graduated from Rutgers and, as a good Jersey guy, I moved back home with my folks. It was a little edgy being there, but it was cool. I had some space and could go to some clubs like \"The Old Straw Hat\" in Green Brook to see bands like \"Willow Street\" and \"Joe Bonanno and the Godsons of Soul\". But, that night, I was home. My stereo was set up in the living room of the house and the show was starting at 8pm. I was ready. I sat down at my Nikko 7075 receiver, put on my headphones and put a six-pack next to me. Right there. Right in the living room. Right next to my folks who kept walking by all night and asking if I was okay, or if I needed anything. I was entrenched in the concert and oblivious to almost everything going on around me. It was truly the poor man's version of the promised land. While FM radio was cool, for some reason I kept getting static on 102.7 and needed to sit up, take notice and keep hitting the filters on my receiver so that I could get a good recording. As the night went on, all I could do was to make sure that I fine-tuned the radio so that it would be as good as it could be. I succeeded and played that cassette until I somehow bought a clean copy of that show at the New Year's Eve show at Nassau Coliseum a few years later. So, what about Ls Piece de Resistance? A true masterpiece. From the opening chords of Badlands, Streets and Spirit, you could tell that Bruce was kicking off his homecoming shows and was ready to rock. The combination of the intro of The Promised Land that ran into a strong Prove It All Night was awesome as Bruce played with the crowd both at the show and in radioland. By the time that he played my favorite concert tune, Kitty's Back, we were just coming out of an epic Meeting Across The River into Jungleland combo - and the Big Man nailed that sax solo. We thought that we had no emotional energy left. But, the show was only half over\u2026 The Buddy Holly beat of Not Fade Away into She's The One was masterful and we could have listened to Max all night long, but then came everyone's consensus highlight of the night - Backstreets - with the Little Girl You Lied and You've Got To Stop interludes. You could hear a pin drop all the way into that living room in West Orange, NJ. Hiding on the Backstreets\u2026we'd swear forever friends (still my signature line when I send notes to my Bruce friends). Best version ever. As the show wound UP, the roller coaster of emotions continued when the girls came along - Rosie, Sandy, Wendy. Wow. What a night. All I can say is that I was almost there - just like hundreds of thousands of others on that night. If you have ever been to any concert of Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band, you get it. And, you were there, too.

I had attended the Fox radio show (Saturday), alone, and would return with my partner of less than six months, and four other friends for this show.</p>\n<p>I went in to my office late Sunday morning and found my good friend, Michael McGuire, in his office. Michael would later write a widely distributed essay, \"Darkness on the Edge of Town: Bruce Springsteen's Rhetoric of Optimism and Despair\".</p>\n<p>Michael asked, \"how was it?\"</p>\n<p>I felt like a cat who had just eaten a giant canary. What can you say? No superlatives can come close to describing what I had seen the previous night. I said simply, \"it was OK,\" probably one of the biggest understatements ever made.</p>\n<p>The Fox is an historic, elegant theater and had stickly controlled seating. On Saturday, during \"Spirit in the Night,\" which was indeed the third song both nights, Bruce had jumped into the right eisle (facing the stage), ran out about six rows and sang part of the song while standing on a seat.</p>\n<p>On Sunday we were sitting in Row J (10) just to the right of that eisle. About a minute into Spirit in the Night I urged my wife to follow me out. She is shy and was reluctant, but I insisted and both of us found ourselves standing in the eisle trying to unobtrusively drift towards the stage. An usher quickly arrived and aggressively ordered us back in our seats. We slowly headed back up the eisle, but about the time we arrived back at row 10, Bruce jumped into the audience, exactly as he had on the previous night.</p>\n<p>My wife's shyness disappeared in the wink of a young girl's eye. She was the first to get to him. He made no effort to resist her looong kiss on the cheek. We both helped support him as he sang a verse of Spirit in the Night.</p>\n<p>Fast forward 18 years - I was at a Ghost of Tom Joad show in Columbia, South Carolina. I had read that he had been coming out and meeting fans after some Ghost shows. There were 30 or 40 of us waiting at the stage - a really good sign was that they hadn't run us out - about 20 minutes after the show when he came out.</p>\n<p>He couldn't have been nicer or more gratious. He signed whatever people had to sign, posed for pictures with a few kids whose parents lifted them onto the stage, and briefly chatted with each person. I was near the far side of the stage, and one of the last people he would get to. I was thinking, over and over, \"what can I say that he hasn't heard a million times.\"</p>\n<p>Finally, he arrives. I shook his hand and said, \"I'm John Hocking.\" He said, \"Bruce Springsteen, John,\" which I thought in itself was a very cool thing for him to say.</p>\n<p>I said, \"I'm sure you don't remember this, but my wife gave you a looong kiss on the cheek when you came into the auience during Spirit in the Night at the Fox Theater in Atlanta in 1978. Every once in a while someone will brag about something they've accomplished and when I've had enough, I'll say, 'that's nothing, I've had sex with a woman who kissed Bruce Springsteen.\"</p>\n<p>He laughed and said, \"I'll have to tell that one to Patti.\"</p>\n<p>He shook my hand again and said, \"thanks for coming to the show.\"</p>\n<p>I said, \"thank *you*, and I mean the for album and the tour.\"</p>\n<p>And he was gone.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Greg Thompson</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Sorry but I don't remember the entire 2nd set but I know it included the early version of Point Blank &amp; ended with Kitty's Back, Incident on 57th Street &amp; Rosalita with the album piano coda linking Incident &amp; Rosalita.

On November 18, 1978, while a senior at Miami University and a member of The Concert Board, we brought Bruce Springsteen and the East Street Band to Oxford, OH. Part of the duties of being on the Concert Board was to help set the stage for the concert. So I was following Bruce\u2019s stage manager around and he tells me, \u201copen that case and bring me that guitar.\u201d When I opened the case, the guitar was \u201cThe\u201d guitar. As I picked it up, my only thought was, don\u2019t drop \u201cThe\u201d guitar or your life as you know it will be over. I gently handed it to the stage manager and breathed a sigh of relief. The concert will go on! I do remember it was heavier than I thought it would be. So that night during the concert, I made sure I took a picture of Bruce with \u201cThe\u201d guitar!

Here's my story for that night. I was a freshman at Rutgers, and kind of being a huge Springsteen fan was one of the reasons I went to Rutgers. I had two siblings who lived on the shore. My oldest sister was crazy Bruce fan who lived in Sea Bright. Garry Tallent lived around the corner from her in the same condo complex and she would regularly give me reports like \"Clarence came and picked up Garry form and practice in a red Cadillac convertible!\" Like many fans living on the shore, she was always trying to catch one of those small club drop-ins Bruce would do. The night of this show, I was only expecting Beaver Brown. I had briefly met Dave Marsh and saw him at the show and did a quick chat (if he knew Bruce was going to show, he didn\u2019t mention it). Then, before Beaver Brown went in, there was a buzz in the audience \u2014 and it was cause Bruce had shown up. People were crowded around him saying things like \"Waiting on that next album, man!\" I didn't want to harangue him, so I slid past him to head outside to a phone booth cause I wanted to call my sister to tell her Bruce was there. The only problem was I was so excited that I couldn\u2019t remember my sister's number and her number was unlisted! I made a few attempts and failed and finally went back into the club. When I got back in there, Bruce seemed to be gone. I figured maybe the crowd drove him to leave. So I went up and watched the show \u2014 and then \u2014 at the end Bruce came out. You can imagine \u2014 everyone went crazy! I thankfully still had a few frames of film left and I shot the photos. That's Dave Marsh dancing in the red shirt. I actually couldn't remember what the two covers were that they played, but I definitely remember the Rosalita. One of the cool moments is that during it, Bruce hopped up and sat on the corner of the piano onstage, and at one point, he swung his guitar up at one part of the song, and the head of his guitar went through the low ceiling and some bits of plaster or whatever it was fell down on him! Needless to say, it was an amazing thing to see and as you can tell, I remember it vividly!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>OAKWAS</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">This was my first Bruce Springsteen \"guest\" appearance.

Seats were spread out, so we sort of moved around during the show and got whatever we could. Highlight of the show was Bruce and Seger on Thunder Road - especially for Detroit boys. After the show a local roadie we knew from high school got us a bass drum cover as a souvenir. We waited by the tour bus and got everyone to sign it, including Max we drew a drum set under his name. Last to come out was Bruce who shook hands but then ran onto the bus past my buddy who was holding the drum cover. My good friend Kyle jumped on the front of the bus and with all the crowd yelling for Bruce to come out, the doors swung open and Bruce appeared. He signed \"Prove it all Night\" and Kyle went running off into the night with the souvenir over his head. That was one of those moments!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>Iko</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Besides this being a great show (including the impromptu appearance of Bob Seeger and Bruce singing encores from notes because he had already played all the rehearsed material), I will remember this show for another unusual occurence. I was living in Hamtramck, MI, at the time and got tickets as soon as they went on sale. Given the smallish venue, it sold out quickly and the word around Detroit was that tickets for this show were either gone, gone, gone, or astronomically priced. Given that Ann Arbor is almost an hour's drive from Detroit, few people that did not have tickets bothered to come out to the show. When we arrived at the arena shortly after the scheduled start time (the band was just coming on stage), there were a number of scalpers standing around outside trying to outdo each other just to get rid of handfuls of unsold tickets for just a couple of bucks each. I suppose I should have bought one to keep as a souvenir, but my head was elsewhere at the time\u2026.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>TM</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">It was a little different because The River had not actually come out yet. so some of the songs were unfamiliar. He did forget the words and I think at one point pulled out a sheet with the words on it. And of course when Seger came on it was awesome. All in all a great night was had by all.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>MJB</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Okay, so we're nearly 25 years removed from this one, but not all history is recorded at the moment, don't you know. Anyway, a few things stand out from this one. The first is that Springsteen chose to open his River tour in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on the surface hardly a hotbed of fan fervor for the East Coast icon. But since so many Easterners go to school at the University of Michigan, there was no shortage of enthusiasm for the show, reflected primarily in the long (long!) line of fans that waited for days to buy tickets. Come showtime, Crisler Arena was filled with long-time Springsteen devotees, as well as some acolytes who were being introduced to the Great Man by friendly sherpa guides. It was a good mix \u2014 and a helluva way for Springsteen to mount a frontal assault on the Midwest market. Then The Man came out\u2026 and he promptly forgot the words to Born to Run. Really. But nobody cared, since they were all singing along. It was a full show, featuring plenty from the new album and older chestnuts, although not so much from the first two albums. (There was the obligatory Rosie encore.) Springsteen took the crowd up and then back down, only to surge up again. The second-set starter, Point Blank (i think) was dramatic and poignant, and the Detroit Medley (of course!) encore really tore it up. Then came the surprise. Bob Seger was in the crowd, and Springsteen brought him out for a song. Nobody cared that it was a second version of Thunder Road. Seeing the two stars on stage together was enough. They could have sung Happy Birthday and raised the roof. In the end, it was a triumphant night for Springsteen. He had started his tour in a new place and succeeded on a grand scale.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

We barely sat down in our first balcony seats when the band walked out on the stage, Bruce walked out wearing a tight grey sportcoat and launched right into Born To Run!!! I remember plaster falling from the ceiling. It looked like it was snowing! The River album had just been released. WXRT, a local radio station played the entire album, a couple weeks before the concert. I recall being totally exhausted after the show but felt, sincerely, like this one band would have a sense of purpose in my life moving forward. And, of course they did. As we were leaving, we waited outside the alley stage door. Several vans were waiting. Bruce hustled into the open slide door of one van and struck an Elvis pose \u2014 kneeling with arms outstretched and both index fingers pointed. The door rolled closed and they were gone. Later, Bruce was spotted, as confirmed by the Chicago Tribune, playing pinball at a bar named The Wild Hare.

It's been almost 25 years, but I remember the concert very clearly. My buddy and I were crazed Springsteen fans \u2014 the only ones we knew from our home town in Southern Illinois \u2014 and we got two tickets for both of St. Louis shows: 10/17 and 10/18. Then we won more tickets from radio station KSHE-95 FM, and we ended up taking some kids with us the second night who'd never heard of Bruce before. Of course, they were converted that night. The first concert \u2014 10/17 \u2014 was the most impressive performance of any kind that I've ever witnessed. He opened with Born to Run, which blew me away. I just couldn't take it in at first\u2014 it was a wall of overwhelming sound! The pacing of the show was brilliant, and I can still visualize Bruce swaying across the stage in the way that we all know, singing Thunder Road. Lots of blue stage lighting (The River theme), and Bruce moving in and out of the spotlight to add to the drama. The River had come out just a week before the concert (if I remember correctly), but we had listened to it day and night and already knew all of the songs by heart, and so that 10/17 was a thrill for us. As you can see from the setlist, it was almost entirely BTR, Darkness, and The River. Those were our favorites at the time. How can I describe it but to say it was a truly magical night in St. Louis! As so many people have written over the years, Bruce's music is \"timeless,\" and I kept thinking that night that he was bringing the '50s and '60s right into the '80s; plus he was blending rock with blues, R &amp; B, soul, folk, country \u2014 all of American music coming together. Bruce came across as real, human, and totally down to earth. We felt like he was one of us, and the music and the lyrics came from the same places we did. \u2014 He brought all of that feeling right into the Kiel Opera House that night \u2014 plus fabulous tunes, stories, and a little \"showbiz\" to boot. I could write a novel about the show, but I'll just say that my buddy and I felt we'd experienced something just about religious that night, and we went back and played Springsteen LPs, drank beer, and talked about Bruce till morning. The only downside is that I've never felt that tremendous impact ever again at a concert. I've seen him five times live over the years, and they were all great, but nothing has matched that first show in the way in affected me. I live in Japan now, and I'm looking forward to the next time I can meet up with Bruce and the E Street Band!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

During Hungry Heart, I remember Bruce's microphone cord getting stuck on some piece of equipment and him yanking on it! When he went to sing the first verse, it was dead. He held the microphone out from the right side of the stage and the crowd sang the entire first verse. He was laughing and the band was falling down smiling and chuckling. Later, this became a regular part of his show. Several people ran up on stage and Bruce would have fun with it. One guy ran up and hugged Bruce from behind\u2026and as the guy was lead away by roadies/security\u2026Bruce yelled, \"Who was that guy!?!?\"\u2026 Bruce was in fine spirits and seemed to really enjoy the boisterous audience.

I still remember turning to Matt Darnall as Bruce and the band took the stage, and said: \"I hope he plays something I know\". Well, Bruce stepped to the mike and said: \"CHICAGO 1-2-3\" and launched into Born to Run. It was like having your hair blown back from those old Maxell tapes ads in the day. So after Born to Run, I was confused - he'd just blown his wad on a sure-fire encore! What the hell was going on here! Only later did I learn (and come to understand and love) the magic and the power of this man and this band.

I can only imagine what was going through Bruce's head as he finished a perfect performance with such a heavy heart.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Tom Cantillon</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">My very first Bruce Springsteen concert and what was to signify only the beginning. I went with no expectations, simply because I wasn't a fan. A friend, Bill, had an extra ticket and told me I did not have to pay if I did not like the show. I thought it would simply be a cheap night out. As I sat 12 rows away on the side of the stage, waiting for Bruce and band to come out, I was amused by all the anticipation from the crowd. Well, 4 songs into the show, I handed over my money to Bill. I was witnessing something I'd never seen before. Bruce and the E Street Band amazed me, thrilled me, blew me away, made me dance and sing and feel sorrow and heartache and joy, all within the span of 3 hours. Listening to and seeing Born to Run, Badlands, Promised Land, Stolen Car, Because the Night, Two Hearts, Cadillac Ranch, Growin' Up, The River, The Price You Pay, Thunder Road, Ramrod, Jungleland and Wreck on the Highway was unlike any other concert experience I'd ever been to. Bruce played with a seemingly endless passion and intensity that was simply astonishing to witness. I had never seen anyone play with so much passion and commitment to their music. It was as if every song and every note mattered the most. As I watched Bruce and band perform, I couldn't help but think that they play as if it's their first show, or could very well be their last, and regardless, they were determined to make it their best show. The arena no longer existed as I sat and listened to the lyrics. It was as if Bruce were performing in my own living room. Most of the songs I'd never heard before, but that didn't matter. I remember listening to Thunder Road and Backstreets and thinking and feeling that this has to be a one-shot deal, that no one could possibly duplicate this any other night. But I was wrong. The next night, was as equally impressive. The night of December 8th was also a strange night, because as I arrived home, excited, enthused, feeling so very much alive, my dad, who was getting up to go to work, asked me about the show, but then told me that one of the Beatles had been shot. It was the night John Lennon died. So the night and experience was an odd mix of finding salvation thru rock'n'roll, as well as losing an essential part of that whole salvational package. I can honestly say that, to this day, I have not seen any one as consistent, as dedicated, as passionate, as powerful, as salvational as Bruce and the E Street Band. 25 years later, nearly 120 shows down the road, I had found inspiration and soul in one of the most unlikely places, a rock'n'roll concert. When I tell people about that experience and all the others that followed, I simply tell them, It's like going to church. The church of Bruce. So, thanks Bruce and E Street Band, for keeping me company all these years. The music and performances have been a great companion during both the good and bad times. Here's to hoping for many more nights of simply the greatest rock'n'roll show out there\u2014ever! Thanks for the inspiration and for the sheer pleasure of enjoying music that is, without a doubt, the most soulful I've ever heard. Amen!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

The Beatles were my first love, and the day that Lennon got shot, I had gotten indoctrinated into my fraternity at Rutgers. We were all partying in the front basement when someone came in and said, well, \"I guess they'll never be a Beatles reunion because John Lennon just got shot.\" Total shock (and weird too cause only a minute before, I was joyous, already a couple of sheets to the wind and then\u2026). The next day, when my frat brother said he had an extra ticket for Bruce's spectrum show that night, I wasn't sure I wanted to go \u2013- as crazy as Bruce fan as I was, I was in mourning \u2013- but I decided to go anyway. Someone else on the site typed out what Bruce said at the beginning of the show \u2014 about it about how Twist and Shout was the first record he ever bought. He went on to play the show, and as always, there were definitely great moments -\u2013 especially the Rendezvous, which was a song I already loved. But what really wrapped it was when the show was over, Bruce was basically almost hunched over in exhaustion leading the band offstage \u2014 and then he stopped, did a quick comment to the band, and they turned around \u2014 and played Twist and Shout. It was like an exorcism had been performed \u2014 obviously there was still grief over Lennon's passing in the days to come but it was a glimpse \u2014 just a glimpse \u2014 that at some point, everything was gonna be alright again. It was like a New Orleans funeral where the trip to the cemetery is sad and the band is playing a dirge, but then on the way back, the band kicks into something upbeat and everyone dances.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">John</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Although I missed the first half of this concert, the second half was the best show I've ever seen.

It was very emotional (I remember banners hanging in the Spectrum in Lennon's memory by fans) and I remember Bruce at the end telling us the first song he ever learned to play on guitar was a song he first from the Beatles and they sang Twist and Shout. I remember Bruce and Clarence playing off each other with Santa hats during Santa Claus is Coming to Town\u2026 and the Detroit Medley\u2026 and Independence Day and all those great River songs. After this show, I did not go to another concert for several years because I had already seen the ultimate show.

Their ability to go on with this show, on the heels of John Lennon being shot; and open with a speech that paid full tribute to the importance of John Lennon on Bruce's life (on all of our lives) - he mentioned something to the effect that if it wasn't for John Lennon he wouldn't be where he was, and that sometimes all you can do is go out there and play; then launched right into Born To Run\u2026. unexplainable power; if that wasn't enough, he closes with Twist and Shout\u2026 it was a fitting and powerful combination of rocking the house down, and making everyone (and I mean everyone) cry.

As I remember it, Bruce said at first he didn't want to play; that the first tune he learned on the guitar was a John Lennnon tune. But he didn't know what else to do and then broke into Born to Run. Incredible. Then after he played his encore, the lights came up and everyone started putting their coats on, the band started walking off then turned around, got their instruments and broke into Twist and Shout - obviously the \"first tune\" Bruce had alluded to earlier.

My GF got me tix for my birthday, only problem was she was a huge Beatles fan. She had been crying all day, and when Bruce opened the show with his remarks she burst into tears again. She wasn't alone - I would say half the place was crying. But the band was remarkable that night, pouring all they had into that show. And then the encore of Twist &amp; Shout, with all the lights on, you could clearly see more than half the crowd in tears.

That was my 5th. The best concert in the history of Bruce &amp; E Street. Miami said that and Max told me that himself. I have a poor recording of it.

I left the show thinking that Borg couldn't hang with Bruce at all and Borg at the time was probably the fittest athlete on the planet. I had seats in the mid right section behind the stage and Bruce made sure we weren't forgotten. It seemed Van Zandt was the musical leader of the band that night and Bruce was turned loose to entertain. About every fourth or fifth song after the intermission Bruce would sing a slow acoustic and those of us in the back could see the band bent over and gasping for air while all the lights were on Bruce. I'm thinking this guy is from another planet and his band is having trouble keeping up. He opened with Born To Run and I haven't heard it played live any better.

It's still my go to CD.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Walter Molecue</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Wow.

And a long show. I can remember Bruce running around the stage asking what time it was we neared midnight on New Year's Eve. He kept trying to fit songs in before midnight struck. So he jammed in Held Up Without a Gun in record time and then In the Midnight Hour before the balloons came down covering us as he played Auld Lang Syne. Then it was just encore after encore down to Twist and Shout and Raise Your Hand. Aside from the first time i saw Bruce in '78 on the Darkness tour (at the same venue), this was the most memorable. A true party that no one wanted to leave\u2026including Bruce.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

We sold a new car to Marc Brickman, Bruce's Lighting Manager. Marc lived in West LA and brought his car in for standard servicing. Back in those days we would manually update the owner's manual maintenance chart when the servicing was finished. The owners manual was in the glove compartment, as was a single cassette tape. I played it in the car for a few seconds, then made a mad dash to our bachelor beach house on the Strand in Hermosa Beach about two miles away. I tossed the tape to my buddy Les to perform the dub on the quite analog dual tape deck rig. I hurried back to work and Les returned the tape about an hour later before Marc picked up his serviced car. The reason Marc had that tape was explained during the show. As Bruce introduces \"Stolen Car\", he mentions going to a friends wedding at a temple\u2026 well that was Marc's wedding. The tape warp in \"Stolen Car\" was where the original dubbed audio tape had ripped and Les had to use scotch tape to piece it back together.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I believe the show lasted about 4 to 4.5 hrs, and was split in to two sets with 2 or 3 encores.

The other was his playing of \"Who'll Stop The Rain\" and his dedication of the song to John Lennon, who had been killed a couple of months earlier.

It was hard to believe I'd finally see him. I'd heard the records and watched the videos; read the books and articles and listened to the concerts: was he really that good, the spirit of Rock and Roll? Momentarily a nagging doubt would come, would my hero fall flat on his face? Or, more poignantly, is a dream a lie that don't come true or is it something worse? Tonight the Forest's packed to the rafters. It's the city's main venue, 8,000 seats. The fastest sell-out in Belgian rock history; the promoters said they could have sold it out six times, and the first time tickets had been put on sale mail order only. Outside kids scramble for tickets, the going rate anything from 2,000 BF to 8,000 BF (\u00a325 to \u00a3100). It's raining relentlessly. Inside the atmosphere builds. The Boss walks on holding an acoustic and sings an old Presley ballad 'Dreams'. Before the applause has died, the stage is bathed in colour and the band launch into 'Prove It All Night', 'The Ties That Bind' and 'Out In The Street'. It's hard to take it all in, but this time you know it's for real. Bruce looks as if he just walked off a construction site; the archetypal American worker. Clarence dominates his side of the stage; he's huge, his presence is immense. We then get a venomous version of 'Darkness', the lights highlighting the drama high on the hill to great effect. 'Darkness' was followed by a rap, 'Independence Day', and a haunting version of 'Who'll Stop The Rain'; the boss answers to no nukes. And who will stop the rain when some cracked actor has his finger on the button? The man's energy is incredible, he never seems to stop moving. Miami Steve takes over lead duties while the boss plays harmonica on 'The River'. Steve, sharp, cool and clean, and as always, be-hatted; he reminds you of one of the characters in 'Born To Run'. But there are no punks in 'The River', only real people who live wasted lives with only their memories to keep them going. Just as you thought the band were bringing you up, they bring you back down to earth with a bang. The ability to change mood is amazing. Before the next song he asks for quiet, gets it and launches into a rap. These used to be joyous occasions; stories that made you smile, laugh, fee good, but no more. Recessions and depressions hit everybody bringing out prejudice, fear and hatred. The warning was 'don't betray yourself, don't let it happen to you', and he played Woody Guthrie's 'This Land Is Your Land'. Then with a flick of a switch, the lights flare and the band hit overdrive with a truly epic version of 'Badlands', the highlight of the show so far. 'Thunder Road' ends with the boss sliding half the length of the stage on his knees. Halfway through, he held the mike out for the crowd to sing, but not many knew the words. (It wouldn't happen the next time the offer was made.) And he gently teased 'You gotta practice'. Part one ended with 'You Can Look' and 'Two Hearts' and the promise of another set in 20 minutes. To be honest, we needed the rest as much as him! Part one was tough, hard, gritty, the exorcising of the American nightmare. The second set was totally different; sheer joy, a party. It opened with no less than five screaming rockers, and every time you thought the band had taken the music to the limit, they found another gear. 'Cadillac Ranch' was followed by 'Sherry'. During 'Sherry' he pulled a girl from the crowd. They danced and then he gave her one of those kisses from 'She's The One', only this time every female heart in the house melted. Bruce Springsteen a sex symbol? You bet your ass! Then 'Hungry Heart' where the crowd sang the first verse, and a superbly rousing version of 'Ramrod', Danny's organ well to the fore, sounding more like a cheap Farfisa all the time. The energy level got higher all the time, the man's power and charisma so strong, like Robert De Niro in 'Mean Streets', but with a telecaster for a gun! Before you could catch your breath from that lot, Steve and Roy had begun 'Because The Night' and it was played the way it was always intended, hard and strong with no compromises. 'Fire' was flung away, almost cabaret. Two-thirds of the way through, Bruce and the big man stopped dead and argued playfully. The big man now all in black (from white) with a huge Stetson, like some weird walk-on in a spaghetti western. Things went into a slower vein with 'Racing In The Street', 'The Price You Pay' and a beautifully atmospheric version of 'Stolen Car' (first time in Europe), the perfect story of lost love and stolen cars to escape the guilt. 'Rosalita' followed 'Backstreets' and we got 'Tell your daddy I've got muscles, because tonight we're gonna rock in Brussels! Brussels!! Brussels!!!' America's show opener was our encore and the New Jersey anthem 'Born To Run'. Again none of the wild street characters, but a mean, almost desperate attempt to escape. When you reach the dream, it may not be all you thought, but it's better than where you came from. The 'Detroit Medley' was an extended version which featured a mock collapse with roadies dressed as medics, but he still managed to play as he was stretchered off. The second encore was another John Fogerty song, 'Rocking All Over The World', which summed it all up. And that was that; 3.5 hours of the best music around. The band were beautifully tight throughout, Max's drums the best; powerful, hard; how he gets such a full sound from such a small kit, I'll never know, and Garry's bass held it all together. The lights worked to amazingly tight cues; the drama could have been presented by Scorsese. I'd seriously doubted some of the songs on the new album as weak, but not any more; 'Stolen Car' the best example. Any complaints? I wanted more, but it didn't really matter. When I left after 2.00 am it was still raining, and I faced a 2-mile walk in a t-shirt but I was beyond caring. And if you really think 'I'm just a prisoner\u2026of rock and roll', you're right.

Brewer</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">The 25th anniversary of this concert is fast approaching and yet I can recall the excitement and sheer exuberance of the gig as if it happened only yesterday. I was with a great friend, Paul Askew, and we were seated in the balcony for the first half. Bruce nonchalantly took to the stage, pulled his guitar over his head and asked \"how are ya doin'?\" Tickets for this tour had been impossible to come by and the Brighton shows (15 miles from my hometown)were announced at the last minute. Imagine how the Willy Wonka kids felt when they got their hands on the golden ticket and you still can't imagine how we felt to finally get our hands on a ticket for the legendary Bruce Springsteen and the E-Street Band. The Brighton Conference Centre (as it was then known) only holds about 4,000 people. On Bruce's next tour to England he would play to crowds 20 times that size. Needless to say, every song was a highlight, from \"Prove It All Night\" to \"Rockin' All Over The World.\" A personal highlight was \"Factory\" which reminded me of my dad's daily drudgery and never failed to strike a poignant note. The concert was packed with material from \"The River\" - the album that really brought Bruce to the masses in Europe. (It was not \"Born To Run\" as current revisionist history suggests). \"The River\" remains his greatest source of live material in my opinion and this concert rocked hard. It became quite a notorious concert because in the second half the over-enthusiastic crowd standing at the front actually removed the barriers separating us from the very edge of the stage. I can recall Bruce laughing his head off as this happened. My friend and I had moved downstairs for the second half and enjoyed assisting in the joyous mayhem. This sort of thing just doesn't seem to happen anymore and when Bruce implores his audience for silence these days I can't help but feel nostalgic for those more joyously spontaneous days. I was 18 at the time of this show and coming to the end of my high school years. There is no doubt that this concert closed one chapter of my life and yet opened the page on a relationship that has continued right up to the present. On a humorous final note Bruce finished the concert with the pertinent \"Rockin' All Over The World\". A legendary British rock band called Status Quo had had an enormous hit with this so we thought Bruce had cleverly selected a very familiar track by the long haired denim clad rockers! We all thought this so apologies to John Fogerty after all these years! They say you never forget your first time and although I now live in America and sport a distinguished touch of grey some things from this night remain untouched by time - Paul Askew remains my closest friend, \"The River\" remains Bruce's greatest recorded achievement and this concert will forever be my favorite show of all-time.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Lance Rooney</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Hello Martin and fellow Boss fans out there. I remember this gig well as it was the first time I'd seen Bruce play live (5 times since then, with 2 gigs at Wembley Arena on the same tour, 1985 at Wembley Stadium on the Born in the USA tour, Hyde Park Calling in July 2012 and most recently 2013 in Rome). The Brighton gig has to be my favorite one as it was the first time I was to see him live AND I was just four rows from the front, having queued up overnight for tickets in February when it was freezing cold. My most enduring memory was the opening track 'Prove It All Night' when Clarence, standing in darkness at the back of the stage, suddenly came forward, the spot light shone on him and he played his first scintillating sax solo of the night. I'm now 33 years older, still love Bruce's music, and my daughter, who is 24 years old is also a die-hard fan, and accompanied me to the gigs at Hard Rock Calling and in Rome. We call Bruce 'the King' because he is the greatest singer, songwriter and live performer there has ever been. Where am I going for my 2014 summer holiday? Wherever 'the King' plays in Europe where I haven't visited before!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Bruce was literally on fire and we felt that fire too burning through our veins. I don't think I've ever experienced a connection with an artist and the crowd like I did these nights at Wembley - I went to 3 shows here.

I wasn't on the guest list or anything, but with my good friend Capital Radio DJ Roger Scott, we parked up at Wembley Stadium, London. Taking a deep breath, we surfed through the over-sold throng on Roger's 'all access' pass to witness Bruce Springsteen and his E Street Band play their entire, exhilarating, three-hour-plus set to above expectations.</p>\n<p>Shuffling our way towards the exits among the herds of thousands of exhausted Bruce-worshipers, I felt a firm grip on my shoulder: \"Bruce wants to see you!\" The firm grip belonged to a massive, heavily tattooed 'security' guy with an intense New Jersey accent who was yelling into his CB radio, \"I'VE FOUND HIM!\"</p>\n<p>I'd never met Bruce Springsteen before and had no idea of what he knew about me (except, perhaps, for my recording of 'I Hear You Knocking' and a few others). How had he known that I was at the gig? The security guy led me through the backstage area to Bruce's dressing room, where he was sitting alone. Being careful not to blurt out, \"Great show, man!\" (you don't do that), and before either of us could say anything, a noisy E Street Band stormed through making their way towards the hospitality area: \"Hi Dave, love your records!\" And, \"Hi Dave, you're terrific, man!\" \u2013 and so on. And off they went.<br/>\nWe talked \u2013 about what I don't recall. He asked me if I'd been recording lately and I said, \"No\" \u2013 \"Got anything\u2026?\" He strapped on his Fender Esquire and explained, \"This is like a Chuck Berry thing that tells a story without repeating any of the lyrics, like The Promised Land.\" And he played 'From Small Things Mama Good Things One Day Come' (not the snappiest of titles) \u2013 from beginning to end. It was perfect for me! \"It's yours, man!\"</p>\n<p>He hadn't recorded the song but promised he'd lay down a rough cassette with just guitar and vocal \u2013 for me! \"Gimme a couple of weeks\u2026,\" and I could pick it up at his manager's office, in New York. In such encounters, such promises can evaporate before you leave the room. The way things worked out, I needed to be in New York a few weeks later, and that's the truth. I went to his manager's office and, sure enough, there was a cassette of Bruce's song, with my name on it, awaiting me. That's class.</p>\n<p>Six months later, midway through a US tour with my band, I was playing at the <a href=\"/1982#210982\">Peppermint Lounge</a> in Manhattan. Bruce turned up \u2014 unannounced and alone but for his Fender Esquire. It was good to see him. He waited patiently in the dressing room until the end of my set, and then (although the audience knew something was cooking) he sauntered onstage \u2014 you can imagine. We played a load of Chuck Berry songs and ended with \"Small Things.\" So, good things one day come.<br/>\n<sup><em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DaveEdmundsOfficial/photos/a.568123923250670/1498872363509150/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></em></sup></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

It was an instant gem, one that got daily play on the cheap little Hi-Fi set that I had as a teen. When I heard the news that he'd be playing at the small and intimate club, The Old Waldorf, I didn't hesitate to buy tickets. Even though I was working a minimum wage job at the time, I even went so far as to spring for \"Dinner Seats\"?seats that placed an audience member right in front of the stage (and by paying considerably more for these dinner seats, a person also got some pretty terrible pasta dinner as a bonus). But it was worth every dime. This realization hit me when it dawned on me that I was using the lip of the stage as a place on which to rest my arm. I barely remember the opening act. I think it the group's name may have had the word \"Thunder Cats\" or \"Night Cats\" in it, but I'm not sure. Style-wise they were something of a cross between the Mink DeVille Band and Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes. But, it was Gary US Bonds who was pure dynamite from the moment he hit the stage. While F. Scott Fitzgerald is often alluded to when it comes to the sentiment that there are no second acts in an American lifetime, Gary US Bonds seemed to grin from ear to ear at the sound of adoration coming from the audience, the joy he seemed to derive from performing straight from the heart. All too pleased to prove Fitzgerald wrong. Indeed, there was a second acts to this man's life. And Bonds seemed to be savoring every moment of it. Before the show's start there were rumblings in the crowd about whether or not \"he\" would appear that night. It was a long shot. But one that seemed to circulate more and more as then night transpired. I have to say, two minutes into Bonds' show, and it really didn't matter to me whether or not \"he\" would be there or not. Bonds was holding his own just fine. One moment that will stick with me for a lifetime was reaching up my hand towards the stage while Gary was singing \"Dedication\"\u2026 and Bonds gave me a hearty handshake. That said, I couldn't help but notice that there was a lone Fender Telecaster that had been sitting untouched on the stage throughout all of Gary's show. Just as Gary was about to launch into \"a little Jole Blon,\" he noted that he could use a little help. Like a flash from the back of the small club came a blur that leapt onto the stage. Sure enough, the man much responsible for Gary Bonds' renewed career was, indeed, in the house and now he was on the stage. A count of four and they were off. And an audience that was already electrified was now on fire. As much as I've loved this song over the years. Both on various Cajun records and when seeing various Cajun bands. I think this night's version of \"Jole Blon\" is the one that I'll take to the grave with me. More songs followed ~ \"This Little Girl Is Mine\" ~ \"Dear Lady Twist\" ~ \"Quarter to Three\" come immediately to mind. Seeing Bonds and Springsteen sharing the same stage was unbelievable. I have to confess that (mind you, I was just a lad of seventeen) I got caught up in the excitement. The first thing I noticed was that Springsteen wasn't the tallest fellow in the world. Next, that his sideburns looked like that of a Civil War general's and, next, being on stage seemed like the place to be, so I hopped up onto the stage for a few seconds (this while \"Jole Blon\" was playing). In a few seconds I was properly thrust down from the stage into the arms of my mortified date. The photographer from the San Francisco CHRONICLE (A midget-sized fellow. I'm afraid I can't recall his name) chastised me for doing that and told me I was lucky that they didn't throw me out of the club. Being bounced by the bouncers didn't phase me one bit, nor detract from the thrill of what was happening (hey, at the very least, I can now say that I once shared the stage with Bruce Springsteen and Gary US Bonds). The rest of the night was magic. Pure magic. Thank the stars that school was out ~ I don't think I fell asleep until well after dawn's first light the following morning. That's how much of an adrenaline rush I got from being in that little club (RIP) in San Francisco that night.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Karen Young</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">What a memorable night. I went, hoping for a certain surprise guest, and hit Lucky Town! Bonds was fantastic, and a great live performer. I remember, when his set ended, I started to wade through the crowd towards the low stage. When Bruce came onstage, the crowd went wild! Up against the stage, I was dancing and singing, and he was on fire! For me, it was a thrill of my young life. After the show, I remember that Bruce and some guys in Gary's band hung outside a bit, near the bus, signing autographs. I didn't go forward, but instead, gawked for about 20 minutes, watching him at ease, friendly and gracious.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Other than that, I think that both \"Badlands\", \"Hungry Heart\", and \"Sherry Darling\" got a great response. The \"Detroit Medley\" was the start of the encore, with Mitch Ryder coming out and they did what you'd expect: \"Devil With The Blue Dress\" and \"Good Golly Miss Molly\". \"Twist and Shout\" was turned into a long piece with the house lights turned on and everyone in the place standing and dancing. By the way, about an hour of this performance was later released as a bootleg, which I stumbled across years later in a used record store in Memphis. It has excellent sound quality (must have been recorded off of the soundboard. This is NOT an audience tape) and, yes, I play it every now and then. Great show. One of my first big nights out with a date!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

You know you should stop and help, but you just want to get home.

I wasn't on the guest list or anything, but with my good friend Capital Radio DJ Roger Scott, we parked up at Wembley Stadium, London. Taking a deep breath, we surfed through the over-sold throng on Roger's 'all access' pass to witness Bruce Springsteen and his E Street Band play their entire, exhilarating, three-hour-plus set to above expectations.</p>\n<p>Shuffling our way towards the exits among the herds of thousands of exhausted Bruce-worshipers, I felt a firm grip on my shoulder: \"Bruce wants to see you!\" The firm grip belonged to a massive, heavily tattooed 'security' guy with an intense New Jersey accent who was yelling into his CB radio, \"I'VE FOUND HIM!\"</p>\n<p>I'd never met Bruce Springsteen before and had no idea of what he knew about me (except, perhaps, for my recording of 'I Hear You Knocking' and a few others). How had he known that I was at the gig? The security guy led me through the backstage area to Bruce's dressing room, where he was sitting alone. Being careful not to blurt out, \"Great show, man!\" (you don't do that), and before either of us could say anything, a noisy E Street Band stormed through making their way towards the hospitality area: \"Hi Dave, love your records!\" And, \"Hi Dave, you're terrific, man!\" \u2013 and so on. And off they went.<br/>\nWe talked \u2013 about what I don't recall. He asked me if I'd been recording lately and I said, \"No\" \u2013 \"Got anything\u2026?\" He strapped on his Fender Esquire and explained, \"This is like a Chuck Berry thing that tells a story without repeating any of the lyrics, like The Promised Land.\" And he played 'From Small Things Mama Good Things One Day Come' (not the snappiest of titles) \u2013 from beginning to end. It was perfect for me! \"It's yours, man!\"</p>\n<p>He hadn't recorded the song but promised he'd lay down a rough cassette with just guitar and vocal \u2013 for me! \"Gimme a couple of weeks\u2026,\" and I could pick it up at his manager's office, in New York. In such encounters, such promises can evaporate before you leave the room. The way things worked out, I needed to be in New York a few weeks later, and that's the truth. I went to his manager's office and, sure enough, there was a cassette of Bruce's song, with my name on it, awaiting me. That's class.</p>\n<p>Six months later, midway through a US tour with my band, I was playing at the <a href=\"/1982#210982\">Peppermint Lounge</a> in Manhattan. Bruce turned up \u2014 unannounced and alone but for his Fender Esquire. It was good to see him. He waited patiently in the dressing room until the end of my set, and then (although the audience knew something was cooking) he sauntered onstage \u2014 you can imagine. We played a load of Chuck Berry songs and ended with \"Small Things.\" So, good things one day come.<br/>\n<sup><em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DaveEdmundsOfficial/photos/a.568123923250670/1498872363509150/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></em></sup></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I had the chance to talk to him briefly before he played (he seemed highly amused that I'd travelled from England to be there), and he told me he'd heard Stevie was going to bring the Disciples of Soul to Europe. (A few days later I got home and that news was public.) Still one of my favorite Bruce shows, featuring the live debut of 'Open All Night' and the first full-length version of 'On The Prowl'.

Now this was 1984 and people dressed up a bit to go out, so I was surprised to see some really scruffy guy, with faded jeans and a headband behind us. It was Bruce.<br/>\nI poked Chuck on the shoulder indicating that Bruce was there, but he turned the other way and laughed. I nudged him again and pointed behind me\u2026 he turned to look and his eyes popped out of his head seeing Springsteen.<br/>\nSo we engaged Bruce in conversation between songs and spent the rest of Clarence's show hanging out and talking when you could. Almost no one else came over. It was like he wasn't being recognized.<br/>\nEven went to the bathroom with Bruce, each of us side by side doing our business. When done Bruce reached up on the shelf above the urinal and goes \"which (beer) is mine\". I told him leave the bottle and I'll go get us a couple of new beers. Bruce was a real gentlemen and seemed to enjoy just watching the show and talking with us.<br/>\nWhen it was time for Bruce to join in on the stage, it was like the sea parted and security cleared a path thru the crowd for him.

However while inside, my brother the musician, noticed the tuned up guitar which was put backstage, and the amplifier with nothing plugged into it, and said the bouncer might be right. We decided to walk to the front of the stage, something we wouldn\u2019t normally do, to watch a band, and we read the setlist and were positive Bruce would be playing later that night. All of our buddies, 6 in all stayed at the front of the stage, we did not want to miss this.<br/>\nYour set list is correct: Fire was played as an instrumental and at the break - Bruce came out to a hysterical crowd, and sang the rest of the song with the band. We were crushed up front, and I remember my head was even level with his ankle. I looked ahead saw his boots, and looked up to see him. He was thrilled to be playing, otherwise he did a great job of faking. The rest of the set was tremendous. Of course, we did not know any of the songs on the set list (maybe one, A Woman\u2019s Got the Strength, which would have been written as Strength ) until we read Fire, and then we expected Bruce to come out and play those 4 songs. He played for about 45 minutes, with the band dragging those songs as out as long as they could. Hard Day\u2019s Night? No way! There was alcohol consumed by many that evening. Memories do fade, but mine doesn\u2019t, at least not from that night.

The Dancing in the Dark song had been released as a single a month or so earlier but the video had not been shot and so the crowd in attendance got to be a part of history.

You could see the camera guys running around getting the shots but Bruce and the band never missed a beat. Then after the song Bruce gathered on stage with someone and a couple of the camera guys. After a short discussion, Bruce walked to the microphone and said to a screaming crowd\u2026. \"Was it FUN\"? crowd applause\u2026 \"Did you have FUN\"? more applause\u2026 \"What do you do when you have FUN\"? Crowd hanging on every word. \"YOU DO IT AGAIN\" the band rips into another full version of Dancing in the Dark\u2026 the crowd goes absolutely NUTS!!

It was one of the pivotal evenings of my life. I was 21, just out of my junior year of college in rural North Dakota. I took the bus (my car was broken), and got out of the bus station in Saint Paul on one of the most gorgeous nights; warm, just a slight breeze. I was just off the turnip truck back then - my first time alone in a big city, really. I walked the three blocks to the Civic, up to the long row of glass doors that opened onto Seventh Street. I saw dozens of people trying the locked doors - and just for the hell of it, pulled on the westernmost of them. It OPENED! I slipped in, and found a seat in the lower west concourse just as the band started sound-checking \"Glory Days\". I watched the whole song, after which a roadie walked up to me. \"Crap - I'm going to get my ass kicked\", I thought - I'd worked with Molly Hatchet's road crew once, and I knew how they liked people who snuck into the shows. But he was very polite, just wanted to know how I got in (and naturally, for me to get out). I went out for dinner, and came back for the show. I'd been to one other show, the Who, two years earlier, also at the Civic; back then, the crowd was drunk and the whole place felt on the brink of violence. For Bruce, it was different - it was a party, and everyone was invited! It took, of course, forever to start the show. I knew there'd been a show - the first of the tour- the previous night, but I'd heard no news or reviews. I remember the beginning of the show very distinctly; the room went dark, a spotlight illuminated the American flat, and Roy kicked off the synth riff for \"Born In The USA\", Bruce behind the mic, fist in the air in the gesture that became the icon of the tour. And by the tenth beat, I was standing on the back of my seat (59th row, on the floor), dancing and balancing and basically flying. \"Out In The Street\" followed. Nobody in my section had ever heard of Patti Scialfa, and we were sort of dumbfounded when she bounded out from backstage left and took her mic. Hearing her do the harmonies put the song - one of my favorites - in a whole new light. The rest of the night is a bit of a blur to me now, 21 years later. Highlights: Bruce and Nils' harmonies on \"Mansion\"; Bruce forgetting the words to \"Jungleland\", of all things, and having the crowd finish the verse for him; last, and best, the final encore; \"Born to Run\" - one of my favorite songs - segueing into \"Street Fighting Man\", another of my all-time favorites. When BTR kicked off, they fired up the house lights. I looked around, and saw 20,000 people dancing in the aisles and on the backs of their chairs and, for all I knew, the trusses holding the roof up. I was drained at the end of the night. As I walked out, there was none of the belligerence and testosterone I'd found at the Who gig. I said to nobody in particular \"that was fucking amazing\"; a complete stranger answered \"you got that right, bro\". Goodwill floated through the air. As I wandered back to the bus station, I looked up Cathedral Hill, and my decision was final; I HAD to get out of North Dakota. \"The River\" had been calling me to do it for years; I couldn't turn back. One of the signal nights of my life.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

It was a pretty lousy day weather wise, and I remember grabbing some big black garbage bags as we headed out for the show. We figured we could use them as raincoats if we needed them, since we were going to be \"out on the lawn\". I had been a fan for about 5 years at that point and I was just ecstatic that I was finally going to see my hero live (I had been really bummed out that I never did get a ticket to a River Tour show!). As we drove from Albany to the show it was raining on and off, but I wasn't going to let the weather get me down. My biggest fear was that the show would be postponed. The friend I was with assured me that barring a major lightning storm the show would go on. Sure enough, as we were walking in from our car the heavens opened up. No problem - we popped on our garbage bags and forged on. We made it through the ticket takers and it was still early so we were casually making our way out onto the lawn. All of a sudden, \"BAWMP, BAWMP, BAWMP\" three chords and Bruce says something like \"We're just gonna do a little warm-up number\" I have no idea what he actually said, but everyone walking in was suddenly running in. So it's pouring now, and the first thing I ever hear Bruce sing live is \"Long as I remember, the rain's been coming down \u2026\" I was just blown away, as my Dad had always been a CCR fan, and I grew up hearing them around the house. I was a Bruce Show virgin, so I had no idea he did covers such as this. Anyway, half way through the song the rain starts to let up, and I kid you not, the clouds started rolling back and shafts of sunlight are breaking through to the ground. I turned to my friend and shouted, \"Can you frigging BELIEVE THIS !? \u2026 HE is GOD!\" I still get goose bumps thinking back on it. The excitement of my first show, the rain, the unexpected sound check, and Bruce clears the heavens. It was unreal. I don't believe it rained at all for the rest of the show. Did they know there was about to be a break in the storm? I don't know, and it doesn't really matter. It was an unforgettable moment in my life, and I can't even imagine a cooler initiation into the \"Live Bruce Club\"! The show was fantastic. Some other memories and highlights \u2026 I remember seeing someone with a big \"Michael Jackson Sucks\" sign and thinkin' \"yeah, he sure as hell ain't the Boss!\" \u2026 Every song in the setlist was a first for me, so every single one of them was special\u2026 Hearing Bruce wail on the harmonica for the first time (and every time since) was just incredible \u2026 I wasn't, and I'm still not a big Stones fan, but hearing Bruce do Street Fighting Man was quite cool\u2026 . Detroit Medley to close the show was also surreal for me - just left me like - wow \u2026 It was a long, rocking show (like they aren't all - right?) that left me with a huge, sh*t-eating grin on my face. I knew that day that seeing Bruce live would be a lifelong passion of mine. 20+ years later, I have yet to find any other entertainment experience that even comes close.

Every time I tell people this story, they think I'm embellishing, but it really happened that way. There was a real sense of connection among the fans as we waited to get to our muddy spots on the lawn. People were sharing beers (because you couldn't bring them in), playing \"name that Springsteen song\" by singing a couple lines, and just reveling in the not-so-soft summer rain. Then there was the show itself\u2026 which remains one of the single most powerful performances I've every witnessed.

Called and Called and got one of the last few seats being sold, second row from top in 300 section behind the stage. It didn't matter. I was never so excited in my life to finally see the man and the band I had been playing almost exclusively in my walk-man since about 1980. I had a few boots, so I knew a little of what to expect. Bruce did not disappoint, opening with Born in the USA in that defiant, almost screaming style of his. They didn't have video monitors in Hartford back then, had to glimpse him through the light rigging from way up on high behind the stage. But I had a great view of the first few rows. And saw what Bruce did, an mesmerized crowd. I remember this little girl (maybe about 12) in the first row who sat most of the night with a program opened up in front of her, enthralled, hypnotized \u2014 she had met her Elvis I think. Every song was more exciting for me than the one before. I got lost in the music, time and space seemed to collapse and then we hit Born to Run and I felt one with the crowd. Highlights for me were Pink Cadillac (without story, Rave On for Buddy Holly, and the whole encore \u2014 lights on and everybody dancing to the D-Medley and the salsa infused Twist and Shout.

We assumed faith would be rewarded. As we are exiting the Mass Pike at the Sturbridge toll booth, I am not paying attention to the road and hit the high curbed median strip and get a double blow out!!! We limp over to the side of the road, about 200 feet from the tolls. It's 6:30pm and we are about 45 minutes from Hartford. We keep our spirits high and get to changing one of the tires. I run up to the toll booth and ask to use the phones, (remember the days before cell phones?)I call 10 service stations all of who cannot help us or do not answer, it is Saturday evening on Labor Day weekend!! We are screwed! As I am jogging back to the car, the boys already have the tire changed, it is now, 6:50 PM, we are brainstorming and as we are, BITUSA is blaring from my very loud stereo. Traffic is busy and we then hear a couple horns blowing, looking towards the traffic, we see a Volvo cutting across the toll lines towards our breakdown. The car rolls up and out jumps a guy who asks if we are going to see Bruce Springsteen. He has Jersey plates. He is heading in the other direction, but is a huge Bruce fan and heard the music, he GIVES us his spare tire in exchange for promise of a return favor 'someday', he drives off. It is now 7:00PM. We change the tire and get on our way. Hartford here we come! We arrive in Hartford at 7:50 and begin to plan on how we are going to find 4 tickets for a show that is starting in 10 minutes. As we sit at a red light we assign who will go to what corner and how much are we willing to pay for the tickets, if we can find any. At the light a van pulls up next to us, they are singing and playing Bruce loud, they look over to us and roll down their window. First words out of their mouths\u2026\u2026 \"hey we have 4 extra tickets, do you need any??\" UFB! We scoop up the tickets for face, park the Volvo with it's spare tire and adopted tire, run to the Civic Center, go in with our just bought tix and walk into the arena just as BITUSA starts.

Hoping for a glimpse of my hero, or anybody connected to Bruce, something not completely decipherable came over the PA about Springsteen Tickets. I saw a mad dash by a half dozen people from every corner of the civic center atrium/mall. I joined hoping I had some money in my pockets for tickets. I was able to buy 2 in the third row in a side section, Clarences side. My first glimpse of Bruce was now going to be a doubleheader, back to back nights. Still on a natural high from Night 1, I found my seat almost on top of Clarences Sax collection with a clear view of Bruce's mike. The show again was excellent. And quite a few of my favorites skipped in Night One made the second show, Spirits, Prove it all Night, and the River. Night 2 was just as powerful as night 1.

There is a movie theater in Morristown, New Jersey known as the Community Theater (now a performing arts center named the Mayo Performing Arts Center which seated approximately 1200 people at that time). It was a grand theater back in the 1800's and was beautifully restored in the 1990's and again in 2009. At the time it was pretty run down and had remained vacant for years. To have a concert there was unusual. The concert was billed as Southside Johnny &amp; The Asbury Jukes with special guest. There were two shows (an early and a late). All the Bruce fans knew that Bruce was in New York State the night before with the band so he was ruled out. Many figured perhaps it was Miami Steve that was the special guest. The first show came and went with no special guest. The second show was when things got interesting. I was about a dozen rows from the stage. At the end of the show a figure walked on stage in a leather jacket with his back to the crowd. My sister said \"look who is on stage\". I was already out of my seat heading for the stage (I recognized the leather jacket). It was in fact Bruce. I was a few rows from the stage. It seemed as though it was truly a spontaneous appearance. Bruce had the band huddled around him as he showed them chord progressions. He toyed with the crowd. Where is Morris(town) and how did he get a town named after him? Bruce and The Jukes played \"Mustang Sally\" &amp; \"In The Midnight Hour\" and another song which escapes me. His face was glowing as he performed. You could just see how much fun he was having. It was truly a rare experience for me to be so close, actually looking into Bruce's eyes as he was singing. And I AM the guy who is always in the nosebleed seats.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

The attendant asked us if we knew who was playing tonight, and we said hell yeah, the boss. He said no, this is the Rod Stewart concert, Bruce is at the Sports Arena! We booked outta there and made it to the concert just in time. What a night! I've been in the Corps now for 23 yrs and me and my beautiful wife, Mary, are still avid Springsteen fans.

One of my former \"hippie chick\" friends had become a fan and came to Boone, great concert, great weekend and I was happy to see Bruce, the band and my friend. What you might enjoy hearing about is fast forward to 1984/85 and Springsteen was performing in Columbia, SC. How I got there is a long story, but I was working at a movie theater in Colombia. One day, I was in the ticket office (afternoon) and a van pulled up in the parking lot. There were not many people around so the van had my attention. I think there were two women, very attractive, so that also got my attention. Then, on the other side of the van, walked Springsteen with this crew. Definitely blew my mind. Their walk to the box office took a couple minutes and I told the lady selling tickets to not charge these folks. Told the other employees who was getting ready to walk in and everybody freaked out a bit, but we all agreed to make him feel comfortable. His movie was \"Starman\" and someone that chatted with him later told me Karen Allen was a friend of his, but I didn't hear that directly. They did come out to ask projection guy to turn up sound. Bottom line, he was friendly, open and no one pressed him and I was able to tell him how much I enjoyed the music in 1976 and going forward. He seemed to appreciate it. Much more context to this, but I have gone on too long. I'm sure everyone knows by now that he is a guy who actually cares, but thought this might add a little something. Take care.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

We also had a large sound stage which had a video feed from the studio as well as food and drinks for the friends and family of the artists. But one of the biggest selling features for A&amp;M was our gated parking lot. Most of the artists came by limo after the American Music Awards and were driven through the gates and dropped off at the studio door. Not Bruce. Bruce had flown in from a show in Syracuse, rented a car and drove himself to A&amp;M. He came in to the control room and I heard him say, \"I got a great place to park\u2026 right across the street.

As has been documented, Bruce Springsteen was guest on \"Baby, I'm A Star.\" From where we sat my friends and I couldn't see that it was him. One of my friends asked if a female guest was Madonna (she was dressed like her). Prince asked the guy, \"Bruce, you wanna jam?\" I thought he was a roadie or friend of the band. (We still didn't get it.) After the song ended, Prince was last to leave the stage, stating loudly, \"Bruce Springsteen is not the boss!\" We were totally confused by this. And we still did not understand. Then \"Purple Rain\" wiped us clean. We left the venue rejuvenated and renewed. I read later in the press, and it was confirmed, that Madonna was at the show as a guest. Years later I was talking with a friend at work who told me he attended \"a Purple Rain show\" with his sister, and Bruce Springsteen was a guest. I was shocked that I didn't realize it at the time. After comparing notes, I informed him that Madonna was also there, which he didn't realize. Five or six years later, a friend I knew from the Black Rock Coalition mentioned he had attended this same show, but with a twist. After trading notes \u2014 I mentioned I was there when Springsteen and Madonna were guests \u2014 he responded, \"Oh yea, the show where he left the stage and came back after 20 minutes, and then did \"America\" for 20 minutes? So \u2014 we apparently missed \"America\" completely. According to Princevault.com and a few other sites, he also performed this song as a post-encore at a handful of shows on the tour. I first heard a boot of the show, an inferior one, in the early Nineties. The songs were in the correct running order, so I thought \"America\" was an extra track, not having been in the arena when they played it, nor having gotten the info from my friend about this performance. Many years later in the 21st Century, I heard a much superior recording, but this time \"America\" was edited in after \"Baby, I'm A Star\", leaving \"Purple Rain\" as the last track. The slight to Springsteen at the end of \"Baby, I'm A Star\" was edited out of both recordings.<br/>\nI am informing all that the encore running order for February 23, 1985 was as follows: \"I Would Die 4 U / Baby, I'm A Star\", \"Purple Rain\", \"America\".</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

He was the ONLY show in town (though funnily enough, I seem to remember an ex-Genesis drummer doing a concert at Festival Hall that same night, in an event which must have caused some backstage discussion on scheduling\u2026). Those years at high school trying to explain to my ignorant classmates who my musical hero was (\"No!! Not Rick Bloody Springfield!!!!!\")\u2026 It was all coming to a head. Forty-something thousand of us lined up. The gates opened and I dashed, one in a sea of thousands, as fast as my teenage legs would carry me\u2026dashed up through the stand, tore down the stand, leaping over the railing onto the field for that last, desperate run to the front. Made it. Then a long wait. It got dark. Some bloke in a dinner suit appeared. I thought he was going to be an announcer. But then his friends turned up, and they sat down to play: a string quartet! (Or was it a quintet?? I wasn't counting.) Anyway, they played. Maybe they were testing the treble in the stadium sound system. The crowd was bemused, the natives became restless. The chant arose\u2026.\"Bullshiiiiiiit!!!! Bullshiiiiit!!!\" I think a tomato or two appeared. Fruit, anyway. People leave the stage, looking cross, waving violins in indignation*. The crowd exalts. Lights go down. Out of the darkness \"One, Two, Three, FOUR!!!!!\" Garry Tallent's baseline hits me like a sonic boom square in the chest and we're away\u2026. I could write a lot more, but you get the picture. I have never managed to find much footage ever of this show. I found a local news report on Youtube, and what came back so strongly was the incredible shrieking noise in the air when Bruce and band kicked into \"Born in the USA\". It was like an aeroplane taking off. The crowd was nuts. Anyway, what has got me here writing all this is that this evening I am sitting reading Bruce's autobiography. In it, he mentions Slane Castle in June 1985 as his first stadium concert. Bruce - I guess you'll never read this, but what about QEII Stadium in Brisbane that March?? Little ol' Brissie was your first stadium concert, wasn't it? First concert I ever saw. What a start. Hard to say what has been the best\u2026 but Bruce in March 2014 in Brisbane would probably top my list. Roll on the 2017 tour!<br/>\n*Oh, and our belated apologies to the quartet/quintet. It was nothing personal, and I am sure that what you were playing was lovely.<br/>\n**Whoops\u2026correction. The 2014 Brisbane show was in late February. I echo the comments of others: maybe the best show I could ever imagine\u2026..</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

The crowd went crazy as the distinctive opening notes rang across the natural amphitheater that the Slane Castle site is. At the end of the song Bruce said that \"things were getting kinda crazy at the front\" and he didn't want anyone to get hurt so he asked if everyone in the audience could take one step backwards. Yep, you guessed it all 65,000 or whatever people took one step back (even the ones half a mile back from the stage). That was a measure of the stage presence.

I was teacher training at Felpham Comprehensive in W. Sussex at the time and called in sick so that I could attend this and the previous night's show. It was a gloriously warm evening and Bruce was at his zenith in terms of world-wide popularity. He was a major singles artist at this time and so a new breed of fan was in attendance - the Fairweather fan sad to say. Bruce had started every concert on this tour with \"Born In The USA\" but on this occasion he opened with a beautiful acoustic version of \"Independence Day\". Not many artists could hush 80,000 fans with such a sensitive opening number. This brought the ferocity of \"USA\" into greater contrast and the rest of the concert was relentless in its frenzied attack. I can recall Bruce and Nils donning huge cowboy hats for \"Cadillac Ranch\" and Steve Van Zandt was a guest at the show, foreshadowing his return to the band by about 14 years. Nils was a great foil for Bruce and I rather miss the fact that he tends to be relegated to the sides these days. \"Trapped\" was a highlight with thousands of people punching the air and I loved his soulful version of \"Can't Help Falling In Love\" which he dedicated to the King of rock and roll himself. In my opinion Bruce has never bettered the final 1-2-3 punch of \"Ramrod\", \"Twist and Shout\" and \"Do You Love Me\". I can recall completely losing my voice at the concert and explaining to my school that I'd had a nasty cold! I had planned to see all 3 Wembley shows but I (reluctantly) missed the Saturday gig to attend Andy Foster's wedding - cheers Andy!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Antony Holman</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">This was the first concert I'd ever been to, and still the best.

We were at the end of the stadium (football field) and our tickets said \"obstructed view\". I couldn't figure out what the obstruction could possible be until we got there and realized the mixing booth obliterated our view of center stage! As you know, there were huge screens anyway, but still it was a bit annoying. The show was amazing. Even though I had only become a fan since The River, I had, like any decent fan, gone back and purchased all previous albums (yes, vinyl). I remember trying to keep track of the songs as he played them but not wanting to waste the time of writing them down. He did the usual food bank donation psa which I know helped the food bank for years to come as my place of work donated money to the food bank every Christmas after that - because of Bruce.

In a panic, but not letting the winners know, I asked the bus driver to stop and the next exit so I could get to a payphone and call my boss. The show was sold out. I was told to just go to the Oakland Coliseum and ask for our rep from Columbia Records. The plan was, if I could not get in to the show with my winners, I was to take them to Fisherman's Wharf for a nice dinner which meant I would surely be beaten by a mob of angry drunken winners if this did not work out. We got to the parking lot of the Coliseum, I still had not told the winners there was a problem. I told them to remain in the bus. I went to look for the guy from Columbia Records. I found him! He said Bruce heard about the problem and laughed. He had an allotment of tickets for friends and family and he gave them all to us.

I'm glad the two of us were outvoted and stayed, which true to memory was well worth forging the weather.

So we went down to the club, ordered some Corona's (the most popular summer beer of '87 in NJ) and waited for the man to show up. We were there for a while and all of a sudden you just knew that Bruce was in the building. A certain vibe permeated the crowd like a static charge or something. Or then again maybe it was just me. Anyway, the man himself made his way to a corner of a bar accompanied by an older gentleman and a few women. There were bottles of booze up on the bar for their private consumption and it seemed like there was dedicated bartender for the small entourage. After having a few drinks and laughs with some fans and friends it was time to make some music. Bruce got up and played a few tunes with a borrowed guitar and much to our surprise, reggae style! Very different but very cool. I was about 5 feet away from Bruce, directly in front of him. It was all so surreal. I was used to seeing him in magazines, on album covers and in arenas. There he was just 60 inches away. After the performance Bruce was just hanging out with the few people he came with. My friend and I went up to talk to him. Now what do you say to a man who has become a Rock and Roll icon? So my genius friend (who I am still friends with) said to the Boss \"You know, you look very familiar\". And Bruce said \"Oh yeah\"? Then my friend said \"Yeah, you look just like Clarence Clemons\"! Bruce then replied \"No man, I'm not Clarence, she's Clarence\" as he pointed to a young, very attractive, Jersey Girl that was trying her best to hang all over Bruce. We all just laughed and went on with our night. It seems like about 100 years ago and yesterday all at the same time. What a night.

This is from the section about the Maryjean and 9 Others tour with Marshall Crenshaw, Graham Maby, and myself. This was one of the last dates of the tour and one of my last dates playing with Marshall.</em></sup></p>\n<p>\u2026 We had a gig at The Stone Pony is Asbury Park, NJ. Some of you readers may know that Bruce Springsteen sometimes frequents that club and has been known to sit in with bands performing there. We had played there many times, but never had met him. Lots of times when we played in New Jersey, Garry Tallent would come and visit us. Garry is a super nice guy and we had known him for years. Marshall and I went to his house one time and he took us fishing for flounder and fluke. He was a good friend. We didn\u2019t see him that night, but Marilyn Laverty and Andy Schwartz, who were our friends and both worked for CBS, were there. Marilyn had been married to Alan Betrock for many years. Before the set started we were told that Bruce was in the audience. We were pretty geeked, but we didn\u2019t know what to expect. We played our show to an enthusiastic audience, just as we had before. It was a normal gig. When the set was over, we were taken to the dressing room, where we waited a few minutes before going back out for an encore.<br/>\nI\u2019m a pretty enthusiastic guy, so I usually made it back to the stage area first. When I got there, there was Bruce. He smiled at me and asked something to the effect of: \u201ccan I sit in with you guys?\u201d I just laughed. A few minutes later Marshall and Graham walked out and Marshall handed Bruce a guitar to play. When the stage lights went back up, the crowd roared like a jet engine. It was \u201cBeatles on Ed Sullivan\u201d enthusiasm. Bruce starting playing the introduction to La Bamba. I\u2019m sure he figured since Marshall was in the movie, he would sing it. Marshall, not speaking a word of Spanish and never having sung the song before, assumed Bruce would sing it. Recognizing their dilemma, they looked at each other for a few minutes and laughed, then Bruce stopped the song and launched into \u201cTwist and Shout,\u201d Marshall would have to know the lyrics to that. They traded off verses and Bruce sang background vocal with Graham and me. I don\u2019t know what other songs we played, but we did a proper encore.<br/>\nAfter the set, we all went back to the dressing room and I talked to Bruce for a few minutes. I told him that I had recently mixed monitors for a Chuck Berry show in Burlington, Vermont, and not only was it an honor, but Chuck had torn the place apart, the audience loved him. Bruce told me that when he was starting out, he was one of the guys who would get called from the union to play for Chuck Berry when he came into town. Chuck Berry didn\u2019t tour with a band; every night, he\u2019d get pickup guys. This would have been at the end of the Born in the USA tour. Bruce was buff; we talked a little about working out and trying to eat right on the road. Our conversation couldn\u2019t have lasted ten minutes, but I was impressed with how gracious he was and naturally, it was exciting as could be. Of all the cool things that had happened to us on the road, this was in the top ten, for sure.<br/>\nI think the last gig we played together was at a New Year\u2019s Eve party for Rolling Stone magazine employees at a place in lower Manhattan.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

My (then) girlfriend, Kristen F., was a bartender at Key Largo and won \u201cMiss NJ Shore\u201d that summer. She called me up and said that the owner said Bruce was coming in that night (more like happy hour), and she told me to get there early and to sit at the back bar where she was working. She said Bruce would be sitting back there, and that he was friends with the reggae band that was playing that night. I arrived with two of my roommates and we sat at the corner of the back bar, with a view of the stage. A short time later Bruce came in and sat two seats away from us on his side of the corner. He was with a guy that I seem to remember might have been his manager. They chatted and we did our best not to stare. Kristen decided to break the ice and poured shots of Jack for Bruce, his pal, us and herself. We all \u201ccheered\u201d and shot them back. Bruce chatted with us for a few minutes, and then excused himself and walked towards the stage. By that time, word had spread that he was in there, and the club had to lock the doors to keep the mobs out. Bruce joined Jah Love onstage and played In My Home Town, Jersey Girl and Born In The USA, but did them all reggae style! Right after that summer, one of the roommates that were there with me had moved to San Diego. Summer of 88 I flew out to visit her, and we drove up to Venice Beach. We were walking the boardwalk and decided to stop in a small clothing boutique. We went inside, and they had reggae playing. I am listening to it and realize it sounds like Bruce. We ask the owner \u201cwho is this playing?\u201d She responds, \u201cIt\u2019s Bruce Springsteen playing with a reggae band at the shore in New Jersey.\u201d Turns out, she was living there the previous summer and was at Key Largo that night. Somehow she recorded it. Wish I had a copy.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Five days later at JFK, he wore a sling on the injured arm. I was a little disappointed that the setlist for both shows was nearly identical. For the final encore, Bono asked if someone could come up to play his guitar (since he was injured). Then he asked if Bruce Springsteen could play his guitar. Bruce entered from the side of the stage and shared the microphone with Bono in a rousing rendition of \"Stand By Me\".

A stagehand before the show said many Sun City guests would be in attendance. The aforementioned were the only one's I actually recognized.

There was a big contingent of Bruce fans from the NY/NJ/Philly area. We walked in and there was this giant grey stage that was awesome. The band would enter the stage from a walkway under Max's drumkit. It was a great way to enter the arena. Bruce and the band were red-hot and played a good deal of River and TOL music. It was a time of change for Bruce and he was home. This was Opening Night. It was not quite home in NJ, but it was the good old USA. He was coming off of a huge BUSA Tour and this was TOL. Amazing. After the show, I got a chance to get on the stage the next morning. I was chatting with a guitar technician (in 88, could it have been Kevin?) and got onstage. I stood where Bruce stands. I was in awe. How can someone have so much command of his disciples. Amazing. I stood there and took in the moment. How does Bruce do this every night? How do the fans rally to do this every night? It all works. Somehow, how can it not? See ya further on up the road - Forever friends.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

One of the girls I went with maintains to this day that Born In The USA (which ended the first \"half\" of the show) was the loudest thing she's ever heard. But the volume just added to the atmosphere. And the acoustic BtR, which none of us had ever heard (or even imagined) before totally gripped the audience. 50,000-odd people all stood hypnotized, whispering the words to themselves. Bruce's intro monologue for it was (I think) similar to the one on the \"Video Anthology\".

The La Bamba horn section gave the band wider and fuller sound in this second set. The closing of the show was absolutely great with sweet soul music, raise your hand and Quarter to three.

Today, after seeing so many other concerts I must say this special one was still the best I have ever seen.

Bruce had already played Wembley earlier in the summer and treated the crowd to well over 3 hours of music. On this night he played about a 75 minute set because we had to sit through Youssou N'dour (we knew none of his songs), Tracy Chapman (she is not a stadium artist), Peter Gabriel (he mumbled his songs) and Sting (his ego was at an all-time high). By the time Bruce hit the stage we were ready to bust loose and rock. It was good to hear him open with \"Born In The USA\" again and thankfully he reverted to playing the original version of \"Born To Run\", not the acoustic version he'd played on the Tunnel of Love tour. Everybody joined Bruce on stage at the end for Dylan's \"Chimes of Freedom\" and Marley's \"Get Up Stand Up\". This could best be described as a glorious mess. If I'd known at the time that it would be another 11 years before Bruce would play with the E-Street Band then I would have savored every moment of those all too brief 75 minutes. This was also the very last time I saw Bruce in England since I moved permanently to the States soon after.

Tour featuring Bruce Springsteen, Sting, Peter Gabriel, Tracey Chapman and Yossou N\u2019Dour kicks off at Wembley Stadium. This show was just the greatest gift I could ever have hoped to have received. Having become a fanatical Bruce convert a few weeks earlier at the first Villa Park show on June 21st I couldn\u2019t believe when it was announced Bruce would be coming back AGAIN in Sept!!! My friends and I bought our tickets and hopped on the train to Wembley where we arrived at around 10am. The gates opened and we rushed to get as close to the front as possible. We got about 10 rows back or so. Result! My friend Neil Soffe smuggled in his newly purchased Sony Walkman recorder specifically bought for this occasion cunningly packed into a Ribena container. Security suspected nothing! Double result!! We were bootleggers now!! My two friends decided it would be a good idea to use the toilet before the show began and so took turns to make their way through the crowd to the gents. Then came my turn. A security guy immediately waved me down and said if I went I couldn\u2019t come back to my spot. I was bursting!! Ok. Mind over matter. For 10 hours\u2026 A 15 yr bladder is capable of achieving things a 51 yr old bladder could only dream of. Showtime eventually came and out they all walked. Yossou N\u2019Dour, Tracey Chapman, Sting, Peter Gabriel and Bruce who was looking ludicrously cool. \u2018Bruuuuuuuuuce\u2019 went the crowd. \u2018Get Up, Stand Up\u2019, they sang. And then off they walked. \u2018Bruuuuuuuuce\u2019. Let\u2019s be clear. My friends and I were there to see Bruce and nobody else. As far as we were concerned all the other acts were doing were taking up valuable time that could be spent watching Springsteen. And we had a long wait. Still, it was important to let them know that we were only there for Bruce. On walks Yossou N\u2019Dour. \u2018Bruuuuuuuuce\u2019. Basically every artist after every song was Bruuuuuced by the crowd who were overwhelmingly there to see Springsteen. Quite rude, really. But we were 15 and didn\u2019t care. And we weren\u2019t the only ones much to the chagrin of an increasingly exasperated Peter Gabriel fan who was being driven slowly insane by the constant \u2018Broooooocing\u2019 in his ear. Incredible as this may seem, there was even somebody there with a Sting t-shirt!! Be gone!! \u2018Bruuuuuuuuce\u2019 Peter Gabriel caused a near riot amongst the Springsteen fraternity amongst us when he interpreted our sheer elation as his finishing his set as a demand for an encore!!! Which he then duly delivered!! \u2018Bruuuuuuuuce\u2019. And then, after an interminably long wait, the lights went down and in the darkness onto the stage they walked. \u2018Hun, who\u2026hun, who, three, fawww\u2019 and the band launched into a brainstorming \u2018Born In The USA\u2019. What followed was just the most incredible set that had a momentum that did not let up for a single second. It was just so good to see them again. I\u2019d just started learning to play guitar since that first Springsteen show back in June and I can remember being chuffed that I could already make out some of the guitar chords he was playing. This show was the most incredible affirmation of everything that Springsteen\u2019s music can deliver. I\u2019d been struck by lightening by going to my first concert of his a weeks earlier and here I was being struck by lightening all over again. This time right near the front!! At the end of his set the rest of artistes came back out and joined him for a ragged reprise rendition of \u2018Get Up, Stand Up\u2019. It was the most amazing night. Neil\u2019s recording came out fantastically well, easily as good as some of the bootleg cassettes we\u2019d been buying from the Jump brothers at the monthly Brighton Record Fair, lol. As we filed out of the stadium I just had one thing on my mind\u2026 To find a toilet as fast as humanly possible. It was the most satisfying piss I\u2019ve ever experienced, lol. To this day I still don\u2019t know how I managed it. The power of rock &amp; roll!! As we made our way back to London Victoria and our train back home to Portslade station and eventually home we were as excitable and hyper as you\u2019d expect any 15 yr olds to be. School was starting next week. But we didn\u2019t care. We\u2019d got to sneak in another dose of \u2018Bruuuuuuuuce\u2019 before school went back on Monday. And we were more sure than we\u2019d ever been that we\u2019d learned more from a three minute record than we ever learned at school\u2026</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

The stadium was packed, probably 70,000. I remember being in first row, half covered with mud (organizers kept spraying the first rows with water). I'll never forget the sheer intensity of the performance. Bruce had a 15-song setlist and no intention to let you breath. It was one of finest examples of what the E Street Band was in the mid 80's. Bruce, in t-shirt and jeans, blasted through Born in the USA, The promised land, Cover me without intro, and Working on the highway. He performed The river with Sting and the Italian audience sang along nicely as usual. Cadillac Ranch and War followed. He introduced \"My hometown\" speaking in Italian. He said something like \"When I was a little kid rock'n'roll made me dream\u2026 dreams of life, dreams of love, dream of sex, but most of all dreams of freedom and these dreams brought me here tonight\u2026\" and then he launched into \"My Hometown\" and \"Thunder Road\". \"Because the Night\", the extended \"Glory Days\", \"Born to Run\" and \"Raise Your Hand\" rocked the house. I was only 20 years old at the time and when he asked \"Is anybody alive out there ?\" I could barely talk, I was overwhelmed. I remember looking over my shoulder and watching thousand hands raised up in the sky. Very intense. \"Chimes of Freedom\" and \"Get Up Stand Up\" closed a solid show with all the performers on stage. Quite a special night. A young and talented Tracy Chapman impressed the crowd.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Highlight musically was the first time hearing 10th Avenue Freezeout with just Bruce at the piano and hearing a new song, \"Real World\" on the piano and immediately falling in love with it. I was excited to hear it on the album that came out later but was disappointed it was nothing like the version he played that night.

Although, the '92-93 band could not even be compared with our E Streeter, Bruce was still quite capable of creating magic in the night; this show was fine example of it. As for bragging rights, some of you have requested a song from Bruce before a show and were lucky enough to hear Bruce perform it. Sometimes, he may he even mentioned your name while dedicating it. Although Bruce did not mention my name he did play both \"Sandy\" and \"Follow That Dream\" for me as I had requested these two songs from Bruce before the show. Before he played \"Sandy\", Bruce referred to me as \"a young fella who was shouting this one out.\" For \"Follow That Dream\", Bruce looked for me in the crowd and when I stood up on my seat, he pointed at me and yelled,\" The man in the blue shirt right there!\" Well, it was a great concert and not because of the two dedications. Bruce played ten encores and he was \"on fire\" that night. For one night, at least, I did not miss nor could I even remember the E Street Band.

Although I knew none of the songs and could see just about nothing (I'm pretty small and the whole thing was GA - with us standing way back) I was totally blown away.

Better Days flat out rocked, as did Lucky Town, an extended Roll of the Dice, and blistering versions of Souls of the Departed, Living Proof and Human Touch! These three are definite highlights of the tour and some of Bruce's best writing in a long time. Born in the USA, Because the Night, Light of Day, Settle for Love and Glory Days rocked hard and had everyone up.

As a younger Springsteen fan I had heard all of the tales of late-night Asbury Park jam sessions, but had never actually witnessed one myself. All of that was about to change. My friend and I managed to get a great spot right at the front of the stage where we stayed throughout Southside's set. We were having a great time listening to Southside and the Jukes, but in the back of our minds we kept wondering if Bruce was going to make an appearance. It was the 20th anniversary of the Stone Pony and Bruce hadn't played there in a while. After the main set, we could sense a buzz in the crowd. The first thing I saw when I turned to the stage was the trademark baseball hat over the eyes. I could barely contain my excitement as my friend and I literally started jumping up and down and screaming \"Bruce!\" at the top of our lungs. Bruce was followed onstage by Patti and Jon Bon Jovi. The band didn't waste much time before launching into an amazing version of 'I Played the Fool'. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It was like a dream. During 'Funky Broadway' Bruce, armed with a pink Fender Stratocaster, took centerstage and tore it up on guitar. The place went berzerk. Following 'Land of 1,000 Dances' Bruce stepped to the mic to introduce the next song saying, \"I always have to play this at least once a summer.\" He then went into a beautiful rendition of 'Jersey Girl' that had the crowd singing along. The band rocked out on the next two songs, 'I've Been Working Too Hard' and 'Havin' a Party' and called it a night. As far as I was concerned it was a night for the ages and one I will remember for the rest of my life. Thanks Bruce.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

The Festival is very popular indeed over here, but most of the audience is teen agers and mature people, since the kind of music this event is about is what we call \"canzonette\" (small songs), meaning simple lyrics mostly about love sung to easy listening melodies soon to be forgotten. Outstanding international guests have always been part of the show though (i.e. Will Smith, Gwen Stefani and Michael Bubl\u00e9 in 2005; John Travolta and Shakira in 2006 to mention only the most recent editions) and I must admit that a few of Italy's best songwriters and performers have moved their first steps on this stage before leaving it never to return. Anyway, to a hardcore fan the depth, intensity and political meaning of Tom Joad seemed to run the risk of being humiliated by the context and the fact that Bruce had accepted to appear on condition that complete silence during his performance was guaranteed and that no stage interview would be released didn't help to ease the pain. The performance was a success, very heartfelt and deep, but that could be expected. At the end it was very funny to see Pippo Baudo (the host of the show) shaking Bruce's hand and not letting go in order to keep him on stage and in front of the cameras a few seconds more as our hero was nervously giggling while trying to free himself from the grasp and finally manage to leave the stage.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I remember my friend telling me on the way up about a song called \"The Wish\" I got an elbow in the ribs when Bruce played this song. I love both the Tom Joad album and that show. Seeing The Boss by his self on stage alone doing his thing will live with me till the day I die. Thanks to the guy who sold us 2 tickets outside for face value.

Not an extraordinary setlist, but a fantastic audience and the setting made it fantastic.

Remember him asking if I liked the show and the only thing I was capable of answering as a \"ehhh.. yea\". That night I did not wash my hand. Thanks Bruce! Long time fan.

Patti and Soozie were among his guests on stage. I was able to see Jon Landau and Terry Magovern before and after the show hanging around the stage. Bruce was really on this night. He was loose and was able to really appreciate where he was playing and the history from this venue. Emmylou Harris and Mary-Chapin Carpenter were amongst guests in the crowd. I was able to meet and shake hands with Mary-Chapin following the show. She is a huge fan of Bruce's and was thrilled to get to see him here as well. The show itself was, I believe, the 3rd or 4th longest of this particular tour. The only shows that turned out to be as long or longer were the benefit shows in Asbury Park and in Freehold. And anyone who knows music, knows Bruce gives Jersey shows they will never ever forget. Well, I am able to say here that he did Nashville a favor that night as well. 25 songs and getting to hear Racing in the Street(dedicated to Emmylou), Shut out the light, When you're alone. These were only played a hand full of times in the previous shows from this tour. I know that there were many many fans disappointed in this tour because Bruce didn't play all of the fav's, but on this night, he was something special. I loved every moment from this tour and would love to see Bruce hit the stage in this manner again.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

While \"Tenth Av.\" they played a Swiss Folk Classic. The Audience went wild and sung along. \"Where the bands are\" was not a big surprise but still catchy. \"Jungleland\" was the next highlight. And \"Hungry Heart\" was a great crowd-pleaser. After a \"Let's continue!\" from Bruce \"Bobby Jean\" and \"Born to run\" made me emotionally weak. It was so great.

My friend couldn't make the following nights show (he had a dinner party to go to) can you believe it!!!\u2026 Any way as happens at all Bruce shows I had got chatting to some people from Barnsley, which isn't far from where I live. I'm from Sheffield by the way. So we got to the arena early Monday morning hoping to get tickets for that night's show, and did we ever!! Great seats at the side of the stage with a perfect view. The band came on and crashed into Badlands then Two Hearts and Darlington County! I hadn't realized that a person could hold their breath for 10 minutes! but I did!! Those first three songs will stay with me forever! The rest of the show was amazing, just check out the setlist. Not as good as the 78 tour, but as near to perfection as I am ever going to see! The crowd were great! not a single butt was touching a single seat as far as I could see, everyone was to busy dancing.

Myself and about 20 other people around us who had been singing every song, dancing every dance and shouting every Bruuuuce! just sat there for about 5 minuets just laughing and chatting to each other. People that I had never met before, but who were now my best friends because of what we had just witnessed. I say that we were chatting but to be honest i could hardly talk, my voice had gone somewhere around Hungry Heart but who cared!! The drive home that night over the Snake Pass back to Sheffield was the best drive I've ever had, I didn't need to put a C.D in the player, the show was still ringing in my ears!!Its strange how the world always seems to be a better place as you leave a Bruce show. The traffic lights always seem to be green! The taxi drivers always allow you to pull out in front of them!

From there on it was great stuff; not always note-perfect but good solid rock &amp; roll. On a personal note I was delighted to hear Factory - a song I love but that I'd never have dreamed he would do. It was a good performance of it too. Light of Day went on for quite a while, with a long \"rap\" in the middle, but didn't outstay its welcome. The closer, LoH&amp;D, I hadn't heard before but made an immediate impression. Even on first hearing it grabbed me, and many of the rest of the audience, and carried us along to a satisfying conclusion.

Again the band were strong, if not perfect, and the atmosphere seemed good throughout the venue for the whole show. MAtR was a great surprise and was well received; I saw many audience members as visibly shocked and pleased as myself when we recognized the opening notes. Tenth Avenue and Light of Day were both drawn-out, with some \"rap\" during them. LoD faired better maybe, but then I have never been a big Tenth Avenue fan. The tactic of bringing up the houselights for Born To Run was a mistake - the largely middle-aged, middle-class London audience didn't look so hot, or so eager, when exposed. But the song still had its usual effect! And so to the finale - its seems harsh to say it was my favorite bit of the show, being the end, but on a second hearing (after the show of a few nights previous) Land of Hope &amp; Dreams really did the business. It sounded like it had always been \"a live classic\" and always would be. Not the greatest song Bruce has written by any stretch, but as a live song an absolute corker.

My first ever live Bruce song - 'Working On The Highway' a lightweight introduction perhaps but still a moment I'll remember always. Other highlights, 'Where The Bands Are', 'Sherry Darling' with it's dedication to the guy holding a request on a blanket from the hotel window that had been following Bruce around, Jungleland (which I loved) during which I had to sit down as I'd been having a few dizzy spells at the time &amp; felt a bit funny during it, then 'Light Of Day' (which I didn't know at all) &amp; finally the final encore, Thunder Road, If I Should Fall Behind &amp; Land of Hope &amp; Dreams. The crowd intro to Thunder Road was the best I've ever heard. I had a tear in my eye (as I'm sure from the screens Bruce did too)&amp; that was it, I was converted. The arrangement of If I Should Fall Behind (with the band members taking their lines) was almost miraculous to me transcending it from a simple love song to an ode to Friendship. Then a rousing (&amp; long) Land of Hope &amp; Dreams with it's rededication of 'the Band' (another new song to me of course)sent everyone home happy. I didn't get the show on cd (mp3's) for at least 3 years (didn't even know you could), but even now (when I have the audio from all 'my'shows, if I go back to any of them it's this one &amp; Thunder Road. Brilliant memories &amp; I determined I would see them again whenever I got the chance.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I guess in those days I reached the highest-point mania about the man and his music. I was too young for the '78 and '81 tours; the regrets brought me to the Meadowlands with lots of hopes and dreams. Never been to Jersey before; I flew from San Diego to Philadelphia, rented a car and started driving north; a ticket for the show, tapes and a map was everything I needed! I don't know what happened but I got lost at some point. I pulled over and a highway patrolman said to me \"Son, you'll end up in Canada if you keep driving this way, the Meadowlands are in the other direction\u2026 you shouldn't but I will let you u-turn here, you can't miss the show\u2026 I saw Bruce performing many times!\". Right there, hearing those words, I felt everything was going to be all right, no matter what. In the afternoon I finally got to the Continental Arena and the huge banner on top gave me chills; I was going to see the Band after 11 years! It was opening night of the American tour! The tail gate party was one of the best I've ever seen, the press and photographers were everywhere. I met people from all over the world that day, I kept in touch with some. Finally the gates opened, I got in early. After a long wait, the lights went off and the magic was there all over again. A solid show, I enjoyed every song, especially \"Stand on it\" rocked the house. I had no idea the Jersey audience was so much into drinking and not paying much attention to the slow songs. I had 2 guys next to me, drunk out of their minds even before the show started! Except that, I had great time and a glimpse of the rocking days to come\u2026</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

The night before, I was listening to the second album and dreaming he'd do \"Incident\". Then, in the parking lot, I heard the song coming from a tailgater's car. Again I thought how cool it would be to hear the song. And though, as I later learned, Bruce hadn't done the song since 1981, wouldn't you know it: he did it that night. Not only that, but he OPENED with it. When Bruce started the number, no one seemed to recognize it. But as he sung the first syllable of the \"Spanish\", there was an enormous cheer. The closing repetitions of \"Good night, it's alright\u2026\" brought a tremendous audience singalong. Because of those \"good night\" lyrics, I never pictured this song as an opener, but it worked great. (Bruce, interestingly, had opened with the song in Philly before, at the Main Point in February of 1975.) The rest of the show lived up to that great opening. Awesome versions of all the reunion tour staples, plus rarities like \"Point Blank\", \"Sherry Darling\", and \"New York City Serenade\". Some nice local flavor thrown in with \"Atlantic City\" (another great singalong on the closing repetitions of \"Meet me tonight in\u2026\") and \"Streets of Philadelphia,\" which was fittingly preceded by the Boss's endorsement of a local Philly charity. But it was the encores that truly took the show into the stratosphere. \"Jungleland\", \"BTR\", and \"Thunder Road\", right in a row, plus lovely versions of \"Fall Behind\" and the then-brand new \"LOHAD\". Finally, there was the surprise ending of \"Raise Your Hand\", an audible. Again, the first Bruce show I ever saw, and since it more than lived up to his legend, I was determined it wouldn't be the last.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I drove down from Toronto with a friend who had never been to a Springsteen concert before. We made sure we got into town early enough to get some wings at a favourite bar and then get to the arena well before the show started. Our seats (which I had purchased through a broker) were described as 'side stage' but they were very close to being just in front of the stage, although well up in a top level. We were at the end of the row which we thought was great until we realized how often people who drink beer after beer have to get out to the bathroom (a waste of a concert ticket to me). The show was crazy from the beginning and I wanted to cry just because I was there. Patti wasn't there and I was disappointed by that as I do like her singing and the duets that she and Bruce do. \"If I Should Fall Behind\" was unbelievable. Awesome. The band was hot, hot, hot and just got better as the night went on. My friend was mightily impressed, as was I even though I had seen him several times before. There were only two drawbacks to the whole trip - the first being the guy who drank too much and kept hollering for BITUSA AFTER it had already been played - guess he didn't recognize it in it's accoustic version which I found wonderfully ethereal and poignant. The other problem was that I decided to cross back into Canada in Buffalo when I should have driven up to Niagara Falls to cross. I believe that most of the concert crowd must have come from Ontario and they were all going home the same way I was! But going home very, very happy.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Bruce helps us in many ways!<br/>\nThis was the first concert for my sister, Karen, and my husband Rick. My friend, Eva, had travelled with me to Buffalo the previous November so this was her second concert. I'm always afraid I have built up the concert too much before-hand and it isn't until the concert starts that I realize I couldn't possibly have done that.<br/>\nRick is not a huge fan. He is a few years younger than me and grew up in England, participating as a drummer in a punk rock band in his teens. His knowledge of Bruce was very limited until he met me. He hadn't gone to Buffalo with me as he decided that was too much money to spend on someone who was a fan only peripherally. Although he did not become a blithering-idiot type fan like me after this concert, he did agree about the band and the man being one of the best performers and this being one of the best concerts he's ever been at; I remember the comment \"He sure gets the crowd going. I don't think I've every heard a crowd so loud at a concert\". I consider that high praise from someone who frequented Wembley, Knebworth and other decent venues in England to see pretty decent artists.<br/>\nKaren loved Out in the Streets and I was blown away by Light of Day. I can't get enough of that song. Once again If I Should Fall Behind was beautifully done. Ramrod seemed to go on and on forever, and we wished it did! The Toronto crowds aren't always the wildest and I would be the one that stood for most of the concert, regardless of what my seat-mates did.<br/>\nOnce again I was grateful after the concert to hit the ladies room - to run cold water over my swollen hands!

I have seen many off the charts/amazing shows that I will never forget (Last Dance in Philly, Giant Stadium Magic Tour Night 3, The River MSG show) but to me, this one tops my list as the greatest Bruce concert I have ever seen.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

The thought was just ridiculous. I live in Denmark, thousands of miles from that legendary place. One thing was to go there for a vacation and visit the Stone Pony and catch a show or two, but to actually make it coincide with a Bruce appearance' It would be hubris just to let the thought enter my brain.<br/>\nSo on that May night in 2001, while it's always a thrilling experience to be at a historic place like the Stone Pony, I really didn't have any expectations of seeing Bruce. Just the fact that I was going to experience Southside Johnny for the first time, and at his home base at that, was plenty to make me excited.<br/>\nEven when I sat in the far end of the room and Bruce was sitting right across the bar from me, not 10 feet away, with his unmistakable jaw and baseball cap pulled over a headband, it didn't really dawn on me what was going on. It was so surreal and yet so natural. I mean, I was at the Stone Pony, the place that Bruce made his own, so of course he was sitting there. But he was sitting there in a Madame Tussaud wax cabinet kind of way. It almost looked too much like him. I mean, he was wearing a headband for crying out loud! It couldn't possibly be the real Bruce. And most of all, I couldn't possibly be so lucky. In 2001 the Stone Pony had just re-opened after having been turned into some dance club called Vinyl. It had been years since Bruce had last made an appearance. So what were the odds that he would suddenly be there now' Practically zero.<br/>\nBut of course, in the back of my mind I knew it was him and I knew he probably wasn't just there to have a drink. It was Memorial Day. Southside was there to do his first Stone Pony gig since the re-opening. The opportunity was perfect for Bruce to rediscover his Stone Pony connection.<br/>\nThe show took place on the open-air stage outside the building. There were probably a few thousand people. Not exactly an intimate club setting. But I couldn't have cared less. It was still the actual Stone Pony in the actual Asbury Park on the actual Jersey freaking Shore. This was the real deal and I was there to witness it. As I was standing there waiting for Bruce to take the stage with Southside I sent a thought home to my Bruce pals in Denmark wishing they were there, but also, I must admit, not without an, oh-man-I-can't-wait-to-tell-them-about-this-they-are-going-to-die-with-envy!' attitude.<br/>\nAfter less than an hour Bruce did come on stage and stayed there for the rest of the show. He sang, he played guitar, he joked with Southside and the rest of the musicians. In short, he was being Bruce. He controlled the thing, yet remained humble in the way that only Bruce masters. And all the while I stood there and stretched my neck to see, tried to take pictures, tried to listen to every note so I would remember, tried to hold on to every second.<br/>\nOf course, now it's all a blur. Including my pictures, but the memory of how I felt is still there. This wasn't the best Bruce show I've ever seen by any means. I've been closer to him at 50,000 seat stadiums. I've left arenas more emotionally and physically drained after E Street Band shows. This wasn't that kind of experience, but it was still probably the most unique experience I've had in my almost 20 years as a Springsteen fan. It's the night that I keep returning to in my mind when people ask me what my best Bruce experience has been. Not to mention the night I keep tormenting my Bruce buddies with. 'Ahh' too bad you weren't there at the Stone Pony back in 2001! Those were the days!'</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

The pen flew out of my hand a couple of times due to excitement and my shorthand in the dark made for some funny reading on the train but I can read some of it, and I'm not SO old (ahem Bushy) that my memory is completely shot.<br/>\nIt will be no surprise to anyone that no matter how much you love the CD, it's SO much better live. Some of it was so appreciably better that I was amazed, in fact. Anyway here's the setlist:<br/>\nThe Rising: It was a good opener. It rocks, it's loud, it works. There were no extra guitar solos as many of us were hoping. Stevie joins him at the mic after the first li li lis and also at the end. If anyone here is as<br/>\nenthralled with Bruce's left shoulder as I am, wait'll you see it go nuts here.<br/>\nLonesome Day: Great great great. For future concert attendees, your hand is to go up at the \"yeah!\" in the \"it's all right, it's all right, yeah!\" part. (We must know our choreography, of course.) Clarence makes an appearance here and by the way, looks wonderful. He isn't slim by any stretch of the imagination but he really looks good. Bruce is proud of this song. Four songs in, he went back and mentioned the titles and he said of Lonesome Day, \"DAMN, that's a good one\u2026damn!\" then he sort of giggled. And he's right. With these two songs he had the crowd; people were dancing already and then\u2026and then\u2026<br/>\nProve It: Man it was good to see that again.<br/>\nThe Fuse: This caused a mad scramble for the bathrooms, actually. I'm not crazy about it on the CD; I find it a bit too monotonous to be sexy but well, it sure helps if he's standing right there singing it looking really cute. Nils gets to show off briefly here too.<br/>\nDarkness! Beautifully done. There's so much guitar that I wish Soozie's violin could be cranked up a little for this one. It's a nice subtle addition.<br/>\nEmpty Sky: He said, \"We figured this out at the kitchen table this morning and we're not sure how it'll work\u2026\"and then Patti joined him at the mic, and the population of Convention Hall collectively cringed and drew back. No no no, I'm making that part up. Anyway there was a lot of banter about \"You start, no YOU start, no you do those oooohs\u2026shit!\" And then they started, and they ooooh ooooohed together, and he did some falsetto stuff, and it was gorgeous. First verse acoustic, then Patti kicks in, then by the second verse Soozie and Stevie were playing, and Nils was seated playing some weird instrument. And it was pretty darned good. I'll take it over Mansion as Patti's moment. An aside: Patti sounded good today; she was not squeaky at all. But Bruce has added an odd hiccup to this song that he must have caught from her.<br/>\nYou're Missing: Some beautiful piano and violin. Bruce just stands at the mic and sings, no guitar in hand, tapping on his thigh. I remember thinking how little he looked up there without it. Patti had what looked like a brand new one, however, bright cherry red. The song is really lovely.<br/>\nWaitin' on a Sunny Day: Soozie moved down to the front and they all just wail on this one. It's GREAT live. It's the new Hungry Heart in that he expected a sing along. And it went very well, considering some people there had probably never heard it before. More Stevie stuff, cute little dances, etc. VERY well received.<br/>\nThe Promised Land: Thank you, thank you.<br/>\nWorlds Apart: I wrote \"!!!!\" Period. Stunning. It's fabulous. It's going to bring down the house. The guitars are overwhelming. That's Bruce carrying on at the end. Also, I assumed it wasn't Patti on the CD (it sure doesn't sound like her) but she did that part today and it sounded like the CD, so I guess it isn't some Pakistani woman on there after all? I love this song and can't wait for Miami to see it live. He will not be able to resist.<br/>\nTwo Hearts: I always skip this on boots but their chemistry makes it irresistible live.<br/>\nMary's Place: the new LOD. He got audience involvement immediately, the house lights went up, he screwed up the words badly and then carried on about how he was glad this wasn't the Meadowlands because he could never take the public humiliation. They had to start over. A rant in progress about nights when you can't stand yourself, can't take your own bullshit, what you need is a house party\u2026but what's a house party without a house BAND\u2026and the intros. He's very cute at the end bending over doing the doo doo doos. The crowd loved it. It went over like gangbusters. It's okay.<br/>\nTenth Ave: My friend said this was an audible. There did seem to be a lot of scrambling around but I wouldn't have noticed.<br/>\nMy Hometown: ZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz<br/>\nCountin' On A Miracle: Again, great live. Lotsa fun, the lights go up some more, Stevie duets again. I love this one.<br/>\n41 Shots: It was received well. No booing or anything. People were quiet, no big deal. The violin's nice on this one too.<br/>\nInto the Fire: Suddenly Clarence is on bagpipes!? It was a very confusing moment! Nils was on a slide guitar? (I guess that's what that is) All these weird minor chords were being played and I couldn't figure out what was coming. Suddenly Into the Fire just blasted off and you can't help but love it, very loud and insistent\u2026and he wasn't twangy. SO much better than the CD. At the end he looked like he was delivering a benediction with both hands up. [Exit and Return]<br/>\nBTR<br/>\nGLORY DAYS: this is gonna stay in, folks, because he and Stevie duet again and it's where he names the cities. People went berserk. It sounded great and they looked like they love doing it.<br/>\nMCOR: this song just keeps getting better every time I hear it live. He started on piano (and he's better; I think he's been practicing.) Absolutely gorgeous.<br/>\nBITUSA: full band. I thought the crowd would go nuts but they didn't really. I don't care for this song in any of its versions so it was certainly no thrill for me. People were surprised and pleased but it wasn't mass hysteria like when Glory Days started.<br/>\nLOHAD: with People Get Ready at the end. (but he really shouldn't be singing \"Don't need no ticket, just come on board\" what with the ticket situation on the East coast and all\u2026.)<br/>\nThe Rising again.<br/>\nWhew. It was THE most exciting Bruce-related thing I've done. So far. Oh and I looked into the black Durango that was parked downstairs and the only things in there were about six sharpies\u2026 LOL.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Stan</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Folks grab all the tickets you can because if today was any indication, this tour is going to be phenomenal. To steal a line from Kid Leo in 1978, \"Round for round, pound for pound, there ain't no finer band around: Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band!\" I was fortunate to get into today's show and to be near the front of the stage where Marsha somehow found her way up and joined me later. She'll post her own story later.<br/>\nThe show was set to start at 2 p.m. and after a couple delays, they let us in around 1 p.m. At 2:15 p.m. Bruce came out by himself and said hello to everyone. Asked where everyone was from and people started saying Jersey towns. He then said: \"Is there anyone here who's not from New Jersey or New York?\" and a bunch of people then cheered. He then said the band would be on in awhile and he wanted to welcome all the contest winners. At 2:40 p.m. Bruce and the band came out to start the show. He said it was great to have a chance to play more than the three songs that they had been playing and he also welcomed The Alliance families who were in attendance. Soozie Tyrell is part of the band for this tour. She is in the area behind Steven and between Max and Roy.<br/>\nHere's the setlist and comments (if any):<br/>\n1. The Rising. Very strong. Band members all have black pants and a black shirt (except Steven).<br/>\n4. The Fuse. Backup vocals from Soozie and Patti.<br/>\n5. Darkness on The Edge of Town with Soozie on violin.<br/>\n6. Empty Sky. Patti joins Bruce at the center microphone for this. Bruce said: \"We rehearsed this at the kitchen table this morning.\" And they then after a few takes, did the beginning harmony together.<br/>\n7. You're Missing. Strong violin and Danny's organ is beautiful on this.<br/>\n8. Waiting on A Sunny Day. Before he started this song Bruce said: \"It's great to have folks in town. He said Asbury Park is enjoying a resurgence and gave the type of speech about the town he gave at the Christmas concerts. This is going to be a fun song in concert, Bruce walks all over the front of the stage and has the crowd singalong.<br/>\n10. Worlds Apart. Some piped in background vocals from the singers who are on the CD. Danny plays the accordion here.<br/>\n11. Two Hearts. Played the same way as on the Reunion Tour.<br/>\n12. Mary's Place. This is going to be the party song. Bruce says: \"are you ready for a house party?\" He said: \"At night I need to get out. I'm tired of my own bull that I need other people's bull.\" Bruce introduces the band during this song. Bruce and Clarence clown around toward the end of song. This song takes the show to another level. It is great and I'm sure will be one of the highlights of the show every night.<br/>\n13. 10th Ave. Freezeout. The normal version<br/>\n17. Into The Fire. Clarence starts off playing bagpipes on this song.<br/>\nEnd of regular set. Finished at 4:30 p.m., Start of encores.<br/>\n18. Born To Run. Before playing this Bruce says: \"this is for our friends outside\" and he pointed toward the boardwalk.<br/>\n19. Glory Days. He kidded around with Steve toward the end and he mentioned some of the cities the tour would be headed to.<br/>\n20. My City of Ruins. Bruce starts off playing the piano on this one. Before starting Bruce gave another speech about Asbury Park and how he's very excited about the new music and record he has coming out. He mentioned The Saint, a bar on Main Street in Asbury Park. Danny has an organ solo here (where the trumpet part was at the Christmas shows) and Soozie also has a violin solo.<br/>\n21. Electric Born In The USA<br/>\n22. Land of Hope and Dreams with a few verses of \"People Get Ready\" at the end.<br/>\n23. The Rising again. Bruce said they were filming and he wanted to do this song one more time.<br/>\nShow ended at 5:15 p.m. Two hours and 35 minutes total. After the show some members of the band came out to talk to the crowd on the beach on the southside of Convention Hall.<br/>\nClarence was talking to the crowd and kept leading them into cheers saying \"You can expect the best from the E Street Band.\" He even brought Bruce out alongside him and the crowd of about 150 said the chant for Bruce. It was so cool to see, Clarence was the cheerleader. I saw Danny, Max, and Steven come out also. I understand there were some major problems with the drop line. Most of the people got in but without some major hassles and some very scary moments. Hopefully someone who was there can post the details. The show was filmed. They had several cameras set up around Convention Hall. Not sure who filmed it, it may have been VH1 and since Bruce filmed The Rising twice, he may have been filming that for a video. I saw tons of Live Daily people including contest winner Sherry Darling (Cindy) and her pal Toots, plus Hazey Davey, Jersey Nights, Eugene, Marsha and many more. Grab your suitcase and your tickets, this is going to be a great tour. Bruce and the band are as good and as tight as ever. Thank you for reading.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Mary's Place is a real crowd getter, Rising is intense live and waiting on a Sunny day kicked ass. Overall a fantastic show, Cover me, Born in the USA, Darkness, LOHAD , Born to run, Thunder road and others. Asbury park was a happening place yesterday. About a thousand or more people rockin' and dancing on the beach last night for 3 hours. Bruce acknowledged all the people rockin' on the beach and boardwalk that waited around in the 99 degree heat for several hours to try and get in, then dedicated thunder road to the people that keep the Spirit Alive!!! That would be us!!! The band even came outside on the veranda and waved an thanked us.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Just got in from Asbury\u2026 what a day! When we heard about the last minute rehearsal this morning\u2026we jumped. Grabbed our beach stuff (chairs, cooler &amp; umbrella) and hit the parkway south. Rolled into Asbury about 12:30\u2026hundreds of people were already lined up, so it wasn't looking too good. Anyway, we figured what the heck-we can't lose- just make it a beach day of it if we don't get in. Sure enough, the line went nowhere fast. All of a sudden we start hearing The Rising cranked. I was amazed how clean it sounded for being outside. (this great mix from open doors and windows??) We decided to give up on the line (wise choice- no one got in from where we were standing) and hit the beach. I paid for 2 beach passes (3 bucks each) and set up camp. Still couldn't believe how good it sounded. Turns out as I walked a little closer I could see that speaker cabinets were set up for everyone on the beach! Now we're talking. Yep, I was one happy camper. Beach chair, umbrella, lotion, drinks, water, sand, blue skies and Bruce. Sounding awesome- full of energy! (better than the other night, when they wilted with the extreme heat). The tunes start rolling\u2026 Jackson Cage!, Darkness!, Badlands!, Backstreets! Not to mention all the great new stuff! All I can say was this was the perfect beach day. I mean, I kept thinking we were listening to a bootleg- I had to keep reminding myself that it was \"live\" not memorex. (sorry- old reference, but you get my drift) Just very cool to have sand in my toes and \"live\" Bruce in my ears at the same time. Anyway, we enjoyed the whole show AND great encores\u2026 Ramrod had fifty people dancing in the sand! After Land of Hope &amp; Dreams (with People Get Ready at the end) Bruce thanked everyone including \"the folks outside.\" (something like that) He also said the Convention Hall was \"HOT but had SOUL\" Then, at one point, everyone started chanting \"\"We want Bruce\u2026We want Bruce!\"\" and out he came for a Kodak moment. I snapped off about seven shots nice and close\u2026very cool. Miami Steve also came out for a few pics. I finished off the afternoon with a 6:00 swim. Baptized in the waters of Asbury! Resuscitated Reinvigorated Re-energized\u2026 Whatever that light of day rap was\u2026 what a day!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

We are on the floor of the arena and all the usual suspects that I see only when Bruce is in town are there. It is just like Bruce himself made up the characters. Washington Leo, Chiro Chris, Joe from Brooklyn, Asbury Andy from Philly and a host of other crazies. The show started of with 5 new songs among the first 7 and Bruce stops in amazement to applaud the crowd because we are all singing along with all the new songs. He is genuinely pleased to hear us word for word banging out the songs with him. Waitin' was song 8 and he was very disturbed and started the song over with a little message to the to pick it up. Promised land was so tight and that was enough for me if I wasn't so greedy when it comes to Bruce live. Two Hearts, Badlands and Mary's Place set the room of about 2000 people on fire. Very tight and rocking. It brought me back to August 1984 in this same Continental( then the Brendan Byrne Arena and me my 1st of many shows) Arena and the same feeling came across me as every Bruce show. The anticipation among the regulars was exciting that evening and we all try to guess what was next. American Skin was a great treat although I thing October at Shea was better and then Into the Fire which just brought the house down. Born to Run was a little flat as I recall but Ramrod was a smoker. City of Ruins Born and LoHaD was nice ending to a great live, intimate and gutsy performance from a very self proclaimed nervous Bruce. The next evening was just as delightful. But how I pine for those Glory Days of the 80's and 90's when Bruce was still 29 to 30 songs strong and he still had a great story to tell.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I can never sleep the night before a Springsteen concert. Having scored a single seat in the nosebleeds (center court, very top row), I was thankful to be able to participate in the event. There s always something special about seeing Bruce in Jersey. I was tired from having spent most of the day traveling (a 15 minute car ride to the train station, a 45 minute train ride to the airport, a 2 hour flight, a 20 minute cab ride to the hotel, and a 35 minute, dangerous walk from the hotel to the arena) but I was immediately invigorated as I walked through the gates. In the parking lot of the arena, fans were enjoying a beautiful summer afternoon amongst the backdrop of the glorious New York City skyline. The sights, sounds and smells of summer were all around Buffalo wings, hot dogs &amp; hamburgers, cigars, cold beer, bikini tops, sunglasses, sweat-soaked t-shirts, Frisbees, and classic era Springsteen songs blaring from a literal sea of boom boxes. Fans of all ages were in attendance although the large majority of the lot was comprised of an older demographic. Compared to the shows I saw at the Meadowlands in the summer of 92, fans now seemed to be sporting receding hairlines, graying temples, and larger beer bellies. T! hey also seemed to be driving more expensive cars. At $75 a ticket (compared to 92\u00a0s $28.50), it wasn't surprising. Just before they opened the doors, I unwittingly sat down next Geraldine Baum, a reporter for the Los Angeles Times. For about 15 minutes, she questioned me about my love for Springsteen s music, the fascination of seeing The Boss in Jersey, my pilgrimage to the Garden State, Bruce s publicity craze in the week prior to the show, the meaning of the many of the songs on the new album, and my expectations from the band on this tour. Since she was relatively unacquainted with Springsteen s music ( Darkness on the Edge of Nights ), I closed the interview by providing her with the URL to Stone Pony London (a great newsgroup dedicated to all things Bruce) so she could transcribe the set list for her report. I entered the gate and made my way up to the very top of the arena (section 234, row 24, seat 9). As usual, I chatted with my neighbors about their Springsteen experiences. The woman to my left had seen Bruce on tour only three times (including his inaugural stand at the Meadowlands in 81) but she had witnessed countless early morning gigs at the Stone Pony during the seventies and early eighties. To my right, a group of kids (late teens/early twenties) won points immediately by explaining why Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band are superior to the Dave Mathews Band. Unfortunately for those kids, an older group of people claimed the seats. Since the kids held tickets for those seats and the older group held a voucher for the same seats (as their tickets were evidently lost in the mail), the staff had to intervene to resolve the dispute. Both parties were escorted away and, a song and a half into the concert, the older party returned to claim the seats. The guy that wound up sitting next to me was visibly upset by the whole ordeal and was actually wiping tears from his eyes. Unfortunately for him, he let the incident ruin the show for him. For the remainder of the night, he never applauded more than three claps and I didn't see him tap his foot or snap his fingers for a single tune. Instead he just stood perfectly still with his arms folded throughout the entire show. The tickets stated that the show would start at 7:30 but, as usual, it took the crowd most of the next 45 minutes to find their respective seats. I was interested to see how general admission would work as this was the first Springsteen show in a while to feature festival seating. The first fifth of the floor (closest to the stage) was sectioned off for what I assumed were VIP patrons. How someone becomes a VIP patron was never revealed to me. I know I d be pretty disappointed to wait in line all day only to learn that I couldn't get any closer than 40 feet from the stage.<br/>\nAt long last, the moment had arrived. At 8:15, the house lights dimmed and the band took the stage in a fashion similar to the previous tour: Roy first, Bruce last. Steve and Clarence received the most applause and Bruce was greeted with a unanimous chorus of Bruuuuuuuce. The video screens revealed a much slimmer Boss with a great tan and, somehow, more hair than the last tour. Springsteen greeted the crowd with a simple good evening. The Rising kicked off the show and Bruce belted out the vocals with a ferocity not heard since the full band renditions of Born in the USA from the Born in the USA tour. He was also more animated than I had seen him in quite a long time. Presumably, Springsteen s pride in the quality of the new tracks is driving force behind these inspiring performances. Lonesome Day immediately followed and was equally impressive, largely due to Max s aggressive drumming. Both versions were superior to the renditions of the same songs played the previous week on Today and the Late Show. Prove it All Night (a concert staple and fan favorite) was next. Despite having seen rousing versions of the song during the 99\u00a000 tour that far surpassed the lackluster performances of the song during the 92 tour, last night s version was the best one yet. Springsteen delivered the vocals with renewed conviction and drove the song home with a blazing, extended guitar solo. Steve was prominent on this number as the call-and-response tactic from the previous tour was still intact.<br/>\nThe Fuse was next. From reading reviews of the album on the various newsgroups, fans seem to be struggling with this song. That was evidenced by the mass exodus during this number. For my money, it s one of the most interesting tracks on the album. The live version shines thanks to Nils stellar guitar work. Darkness on the Edge of Town featured the traditional arrangement except for Bruce s tremolo guitar solos. This is obviously one of Springsteen s favorite tracks as he s played it regularly in each of the past several tours. Fans loved this one too.<br/>\nAfter Darkness, Bruce addressed the crowd by asking for quiet for the next two numbers. He confessed, I m excited too, and went on to joke about taking a calming piss before hitting the stage. But he didn't have to ask for silence. The next two numbers hushed the crowd with their sheer brilliance. Empty Sky appeared in a strikingly altered arrangement. Bruce began the song with a haunting, falsetto howl similar to the one used to close Across the Border during the Tom Joad tour. Patti added color with her own distinctive voice. In this sparse, acoustic arrangement, the song is even more powerful. This was easily the best song of the evening up until this point. You re Missing followed and was almost as impressive. The song featured a modified arrangement that made room for additional soloing at the end of the track.<br/>\nBruce dedicated the next song, Waiting on a Sunny Day, to Brendan O Brien. Again featuring an alternate arrangement, the number begins with only the acoustic guitars in action. The song became an instant classic in the live setting as the crowd embraced it immediately. There s a short break in the middle of the tune which begs for audience participation and the Meadowlands crowd did not disappoint. Bruce even stated that he was impressed. The band kicked in after the audience participation segment and soared to new heights. Great song! This was followed with a rousing rendition of Springsteen s all-time best song, The Promised Land. This song fits perfectly with the theme of the new album. As usual, the crowd exploded during the instrumental break particularly after Clarence s solo.<br/>\nWorlds Apart was next. I had read reports that the band was using taped vocals for this track but I didn't hear any during the performance. This is one of the best songs on the new record and prominently features some of Springsteen s most inspired guitar playing in quite a while. In concert, it s even better. I was very impressed although I couldn't say the same for the woman to my left. After mentioning how much she d like to hear Bruce play Born to Run, Thunder Road or Jersey Girl, she took off during the opening notes of Worlds Apart and never returned! Continuing with the theme of Worlds Apart, Bruce launched into another concert staple, Two Hearts. This was the 11th song of the night and it wasn't until he began playing it that I realized we hadn't heard anything from The River up until this point. In fact, if you owned all of Springsteen s studio albums except The Rising and Darkness on the Edge of Town, you wouldn't have known the first ten tracks. Two Heart! s featured a similar arrangement to the version from the Reunion tour, sans the It Takes Two coda at the end.<br/>\nI began feeling nervous for my safety as the upper deck started shaking during the opening notes of Badlands. All of the old war horses were played with renewed vigor as they took on new meaning in light of September 11th. In light of Dave Marsh s comment about Springsteen s new music being more about September 12th than September 11th, an old line like, it ain't no sin to be glad you re alive really drives the point home.<br/>\nMary s Place, the latest in Springsteen s canon of rollicking set closers (Thundercrack, Rosalita, Light of Day) was next. Bruce reminisced about the house parties of his youth (admiring the girls only a few years his senior) and used the song to introduce the members of the best house band. Each member got his/her due without the rock n roll evangelist shtick from the previous tour. This was another fan favorite as it included the obvious audience participation segment during the line, waiting for that shout from the crowd.<br/>\nCountin' on a Miracle, in a rendition virtually identical to the studio version, was next. Being one of the more expendable tracks on the new album, I would have traded this song for Paradise or Nothing Man. Still, Springsteen belted out the lyrics with conviction which makes the song difficult to dislike.<br/>\nAmerican Skin was next. There were some changes from the version he played in Atlanta two summers ago. For one, the repeated 41 shots portion was dropped entirely. Also, a saxophone solo was added to the end of the song (similar to the rendition from the Live in NYC album). There wasn't any booing this time around, though, as everyone knew exactly what Springsteen meant when he sang the line, you can get killed just for living in your American skin. Great song.<br/>\nInto the Fire closed the main set and rivaled Empty Sky in its intensity. Soozie plays a fierce violin solo to begin the song and the new arrangement is even more powerful than the studio version. This was one of the highlights of the show for me. Here s hoping we get yet another live album at the end of the tour.<br/>\nSteve was having a problem with his guitar which delayed the start of the first encore. Bruce seized the opportunity to play with the crowd while waiting. Bruce screamed the count-in and the drum salvo of his most recognizable song, Born to Run, filled the arena. As usual, the house lights came on to reveal 20,000 crazed fans throwing their last ounces of sanity out the window in order to dance and sing along as if it were their job. I've heard him play this song 17 times and it never sounded better than this. The house lights stayed on for the next song (which will undoubtedly be a wild card each night), the long absent Glory Days. Despite having heard this song several times in 92 (including one performance with Steve as a guest), I had never heard the E Street Band tackle this one. Somehow the song never got an outing during the Reunion tour. Max missed the cue to cut the song for Springsteen s famous false ending, but it was great nonetheless. It appeared that ! Bruce and the band were going to leave the stage for the final group of encores but, at the last minute, Springsteen called out Thunder Road. An audible!! The die-hards live for them. On the last tour, I was blessed by seeing both Something in the Night and Be True as audibles.<br/>\nThe final set of encores began with Bruce sitting by himself at Roy s piano. He thanked the crowd for coming out to see them (as if we re doing him a favor) and proceeded to dedicate My City of Ruins to the NJ Community Food Bank and to the people of Asbury Park. He also thanked the crowd for a fun week of rehearsals at the Convention Hall. My City of Ruins is one of the best songs on the new record and the crowd obviously loved it. The chorus of rise up, come on, rise up was sung in unison by all of the concert attendees. A powerful moment indeed.<br/>\nAfter a fiery guitar intro similar to the one preceding Souls of the Departed on the 92 tour, at long last, Bruce and the band launched into a thrilling, full throttle version of Born in the USA one of Springsteen s best, albeit misunderstood, songs. It was a relatively traditional rendition except for the unusual inflection on the word born. Bruce somehow turned the word into two syllables so it sounded like bow WHAN. The famous howl at the end of the song was dropped but there was no shortage of stellar guitar work from Springsteen two piercing solos that raised the hair on our necks.<br/>\nLand of Hope and Dreams, including a new People Get Ready outro, closed the show in glorious fashion. People get ready, there s a train comin don t need no ticket, just get on board. Hop on it s a ride you won t soon forget.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Ben Corrado</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Opening night at the Meadowlands\u2026after being inside the Convention Center the previous week, was good to be inside a building with air conditioning! The crowd was raucous as the lights went down. As expected, The Rising and Lonesome Day started things off, with both being very well received by the crowd. After a very hot version of Prove It All Night, came a very curious selection. With the crowd on its feet, dancing and yelling at the end of Prove It, he switches gears and downshifts into The Fuse. While personally I do like the song, it just did not fit in as the fourth song of the set. Everyone seemed kind of stunned that they were sitting down so soon into the show. With Darkness following it, I would have much rather seen another song in the 4th slot, with The Fuse maybe even replacing Darkness. After Darkness, Bruce then asked the crowd to be quiet for the next two songs. With the crowd cheering, he got a big laugh by saying, \"Hey, I'm excited too. I even took a relaxing piss before I came out.\" After everyone quieted down, it was Bruce on acoustic and Patti singing backup on Empty Sky. This was followed up by a very moving performance of You're Missing. Let me tell you, even though I was lucky not to have known anyone personally who was lost on September 11th, it still affected me very deeply as I'm sure it did most people. With these two songs back to back, I will admit to my eyes watering by the end. At the end of You're Missing, there was a very long and loud ovation. Bruce, realizing the emotional level of these two songs, knew it was time to bring things back up. After starting out acoustically, the band launched into a very loud and fun Waitin' On A Sunny Day. When I first heard this song, I had commented that it had some roots of Hungry Heart in it, and that's they way it comes out live, with Bruce getting the crowd to sing along without the band playing. He had even commented that he was impressed that everyone knew the song so well already. The Promised Land seemed to be a perfect preamble into Worlds Apart. Between the singing of the Sufi Choir throughout the song and Bruce's searing guitar playing, Worlds Apart had a very ethereal feel to it. The crowd was really getting into it. After taking us on a trip abroad, he brings it back home with Two Hearts and Badlands. Mary s Place has replaced Tenth Avenue as the song where the band gets introduced. I was a bit surprised to learn the genealogy of both Roy and Max. (Those who were there will know what I m talking about.) Into The Fire closed the set, and I was a bit disappointed Clarence didn't have the bagpipes out. Although considering the disaster at the Convention Center, guess Bruce didn't want to chance another accident. One of my favorite parts of any Bruce show is the first drum beats to Born to Run when all the house lights come up. I like to be able to look around and see the other 20,000 people singing and dancing in unison with Bruce. There was a very funny moment at the beginning of Glory Days. As the song started, Steven was handed his mandolin by one of the roadies. Instead of strapping it on, he handed it to a guy in the front row of the crowd to hold onto. But as he did it, he put on his best Silvio Dante face and gave the guy a look that pretty much said Don t fuck with it . He held on to it like his life depended on it. (And it just may have!)<br/>\nA few overall notes about the show. At 2 ? hours, it came in a little shorter than what we've been accustomed to, especially for an opening night in Jersey. Steven and Nils seemed to be having a lot of problems with their guitars, as roadies were constantly on stage adjusting things. At times, Bruce was a little hard to hear when he was speaking or telling a story. Even the video screen near where I was sitting was reversed. It appeared as everyone was playing left handed. Such are the vagaries of Opening Night of a world tour.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Clete</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Opening night of a Bruce tour has to be magical, right? This show was not magical. This show was great. The thing about it is that every Bruce show is great. We always hope for that extraordinary, incredible show, which this show was not. For some reason, the energy dynamic between Bruce and the crowd never seemed to take off. The technical glitches were certainly distracting, but that couldn't be the entire explanation. I think that the crowd expected a longer show, also (we are so spoiled!). Overall, an uneventful opening night show. But still great.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Kevin Kelly</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">I attended the 7/26 Asbury show, so I knew what to expect. As boisterous and rowdy was the reunion tour- The Rising is somewhat solemn and introspective. A lot of first time attendees. I sat in section 120 and most people didn't know Darkness or the Promised land. Bruce seemed nervous and a little tense. The show itself was great, high energy, passionate, etc. The new song are great live and he is able to convey his caring and sorrow personally.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>jsl1016</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">The Rising - Wow. Fresh and exciting, you could see that the band was pumped as well as the crowd. Very pleased and it sounded way better than Letterman or the Today Show.<br/>\nLonesome Day - This song rocked. That is all I can say. Everyone was having a great time, and you could see that the crowd was very into it. This was shaping up as an exciting show?<br/>\nProve it all Night - Ummm. Is it me? He seemed to be forcing this song. Crowd was pleased but you can tell, half way through, that it is getting tired, show lost some momentum here for me.<br/>\nThe Fuse - Momentum continues to wane. I don't really like this song. I feel The Rising, as an album, was three songs too long, this being one of those songs? Bad feelings continue to grow.<br/>\nDarkness - Momentum gone. Until the middle of the song that is. Wow, did Bruce attack his guitar or what? I thought he would pop all the stings on it. Momentum gaining again?<br/>\nEmpty Sky - Excellent duet with Patti. Sor of takes the place of Mansion on the Hill or Factory from the reunion tour. I really like this song and this acoustic arrangement works superbly.<br/>\nYou're Missing - Such a sad song and fits so well after Empty Sky. I was fully back into the show at this point.<br/>\nWaiting on a Sunny Day - Ok, I usually think, every time I hear this song; Bruce Cougar Mellencamp!? I just does not sound like a Bruce song. But Holy Freaking Shit Batman! What a great concert song, especially in the arrangement he brings to it. What a crowd pleaser. A definite thumbs up for the arrangement and placement in the set! Killer crowd participation concert song.<br/>\nPromised Land - Ummm, Bruce, do you have only two albums? Last I checked I had a boatload of legal, official albums that you had released. The song fit well, but it is tired and with so many albums to choose from, your fans would be very pleased with something from another record.<br/>\nWorlds Apart - Has anyone who bought the album heard this song? This is not a beer break or piss break song people! This is a rocker straight from the Prove It mold. Deal with the slow into, stay in your seats and jump up when the band kicks in! I was now very, very into this show!<br/>\nTwo Hearts - Man, if you ABSOLUTELY NEED to sing a freaking duet with Steve pick another damn song! This is quickly falling in with Hungry Heart, i.e. get it out of the set list.<br/>\nBadlands - Classic that just never gets tired (for me anyway).<br/>\nMary's Place - Emotional! I thought I got this song originally but I see now that I did not, until last night. This song is about loss and emotional distress and just trying to deal, if even for a night, by surrounding yourself with friends and forgetting your pain. When he uttered \"I miss you\" I thought of all the friends and Family I have lost over the years and just about cried right there and then.<br/>\nCounting on a Miracle - My favorite from The Rising. I could not be more please at this point, Until\u2026.<br/>\nAmerican Skin - Look, I KNOW this song is not about bashing cops, and I don't particularly like cops, but a LOT of people still misinterpret this song. And seeing as how many policemen dies on 9/11, cut the misinterprets a break and stop playing this song!<br/>\nInto The Fire - I'm still not sure about how I feel on this song. Sometimes uplifting, other times dark, it is painful to think about what firemen do for a living. I watched the WTC burn and fall so this song moves in varying emotional states each time I hear it.<br/>\nEnd Main Set - Huh - What? Wait a minute - Where is the surprise song? You know, the one where, like on the reunion tour, no matter how much you had memorized the set list, it was always a surprise song? Like For You, or Night, or Incident, or Meeting? I felt very gypped at this point, and it would get worse.<br/>\nEncores - Born to Run/Thunder Road ?- I feel bad for Bruce. He HAS to play these, but you can see he does not want to. Especially Thunder Road. It almost feels like he is mumbling the words, forcing them out like they are straining his very being. You can tell he is sick of playing these tunes. As a true fan I would not mind seeing these songs replaced. I know I may be in the minority, but it is just my opinion.<br/>\nGlory Days/Born in the USA - While it was nice to hear these again (BITUSA was on Reunion tour but it is nice to hear electric again), I can see them getting old and tired very quickly. Glory Days is a great party song, but there are others he could, and hopefully will, throw in. BITUSA really does NOT fit, to me, as an encore. Should be in the main set, perhaps replacing American Skin.<br/>\nMy City of Ruin - A really great piece. Love the intro. Hope it remains a staple.<br/>\nLand of Hope and Dreams - I have loved this from the moment I heard it. After seeing it so many times, I sometimes wish he would close with another song, but I love it so much, I'll deal.<br/>\nConclusions - 6 out of 10. 11 of 15 songs from The Rising might be too much. Cut it to 10 and throw in another (not tired please) oldie. Something fresh. Rotate a new song in every night just to give us a surprise. 10 out of 15 (two thirds) is STILL great promotion for the album. Get rid of some of the oldies and replace them with fresh oldies. The tired ones are just that, and Bruce KNOWS that 75% of the crowd at each show has seen them, so c'mon Bruce, freshen it up. We will have a better time and I know you will too as a result.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

There was no comparison between the Meadowlands opening night show and this one. The intensity level was through the roof. This crowd was awesome, and Bruce even acknowledged that they (we) were a \"terrific crowd\". The only setlist change was that \"Bobby Jean\" replaced \"Two Hearts\" (neither of those two are my favorites, but BJ was a real hit). Just as on opening night, Bruce seemed impressed that the crowd was able to jump right in with \"Waiting on A Sunny Day\" and \"Mary's Place\". A real highlight for me was \"Missing You\", which he performs right after \"Empty Sky\" (his \"keep quiet\" twosome). That is one powerful song with a great arrangement. I was seated way up in the rafters, but the sound was fine. Bruce seemed to be having some real voice trouble at various points in the show (I believe that he skipped the primal wail in the middle of BITUSA). The encores were really rocking, and the crowd showed the proper appreciation in return. This show was a real keeper in all respects.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

The best part was the tix came with backstage passes (a first for me). Nils and Soozie were the only E-Streeters that I saw. However, a lot of celebs were on hand - Steven Spielberg, Furio from the Sopranos, Mick Foley (WWF's Mankind) and David Wells from the Yankees (I heard Jason Giambi and Ron Coomer were on hand as well, but I didn't see them). My friend and I were the last two people (other than employees) to get kicked out from back stage at the end of the night. The show was awesome! Mary's Place is the new Rosalita and Waiting on a Sunny Day is the new Hungry Heart. One thing I did find interesting, is that the same fans that gave a huge cheer for the line in Empty Sky \"I want an eye for an eye\", are the same people that cheer the Born in the USA. I was disappointed the set did not include \"Let's Be Friends\", one of my early favorites from the new album. \"American Skin\", \"Darkness\" and \"The Promised Land\" fit in well with the set. However, as much as I love \"Born to Run\", it didn't seem appropriate for this tour. The only downside was the \"short\" 2\u00a01/2 hour show. I guess was spoiled all of these years - most notably the 5 hour Marathon at the Meadowlands benefit at the end of the 92-93 tour, which reunited the E Streeters with Bruce's touring band, along with other guests (still my favorite show). All in all, a great show.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Terry Davies</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Did the GA routine - wound up against the stage in front of Clarence, surrounded by some very cool people. Everybody seemed to know the drill - he was going to play the new album and a couple hits. Glad everyone knew going in - no Rosie chants from front left. The new songs were so much better live - the CD seemed like a dry, academic work as we listened to it in the car ride home. It was a great experience. Crowd roared for \"I want an eye for an eye\" from \"Empty Sky\" - it may not be PC, but the anger was palpable. Bruce really said nothing except for \"NY how ya been - I've been thinking about you.\" \"Into the Fire\" made several people choking back the tears. Notice how he is not playing at all in the first 2/3's of September? No doubt he will be doing what he can - which is always above and beyond the call. Last September we had Bruce - we leaned on him - \"Blood Bros\" \"No Surrender\", \"We Shall Overcome\", \"Forever Young\" w/Dylan and a mediocre, muffled boot of \"Further on up the Road\" were on a CD that got played over and over - songs that remember the people not events. I can't wait to hear him sing those again.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Clete</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Great expectations always go along with a MSG show. Bruce did not disappoint. After greeting everyone with \"Good Evening, NY\" he added, \"I've been thinking about you.\" The third show of the tour showed continued improvement in the tightness of the performance. Just as in Washington, the crowd was wildly enthusiastic, which reflected back again from Bruce. The songs from \"The Rising\" are just great. I think that it is a real treat to be able to hear the songs live with the band so soon after the release of the cd. Bruce's approach to getting the crowd to be quiet during the \"shut the hell up\" set of \"Empty Sky\" and \"Missing You\" was, \"Shut up you bastards!\" It didn't work too well. Of note to me was the cheering from much of the crowd when the phrase \"I want an eye for an eye\" was uttered during \"Empty Sky\" (This reaction didn't take place in Washington or at the Meadowlands). The arena was deafening during \"Badlands\", and that was a definite highlight. The same exact setlist as Washington (sticking with a winner, I guess). Bruce's voice is really showing signs of strain (he could barely talk during his mini-speech before BITUSA). Somehow, he made it through the show with the intensity displayed two nights before. I loved this show, which was on a par with Washington.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Lynn B.</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">OK, everyone, here goes (remember we old folks tend to have a lack of short term memory, so pardon me in advance if I leave something out):<br/>\nFIRST - the band looked GREAT, especially Bruce (in a dark blue shirt with some kind of star pattern on it) (and if all 52year olds looked as good as he does, there would peace in the world \u2014 please refer to the estrogen thread that follows this one); Clarence has lost a TON of weight (see note re Mary's place below), and everyone looks pretty darned good (does Max EVER sweat?)<br/>\nSECOND (this may belong in the estrogen thread that follows this, so I'll post there, too): did anyone else notice that Bruce was not wearing his wedding band? And my friend said she the thought the body language between Bruce/Patti and Bruce/Soozie was, um, \"interesting\"<br/>\nTHIRD -<br/>\nTHE ENTIRE SHOW WAS AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME. Don't let anyone talk you out of going. So it's not 3-4 hours long; so what? there's plenty packed into the 2-1/2 hours, believe me.<br/>\nShow started around 8:28\u00a0pm (lots of people on the drop line, lots of people filing at last minute; lots of \"bruuuuceing\" for anyone who even walked NEAR the stage)<br/>\nLET ME START BY SAYING THAT I THOUGHT THIS SHOW WAS 99.99999% AWESOME - the only glitch that I noticed was a slight bit of feedback (and I can't even remember what song it was!!!).<br/>\nTHE RISING - incredible. He's solved the \"dream of life\" dilemma - it's now very smooth, not rushed.<br/>\nLONESOME DAY - fantastic, too, especially with audience participation<br/>\nPROVE IT ALL NIGHT - Wow!<br/>\nTHE FUSE - beautiful, except maybe a little \"rushed\"??<br/>\nDARKNESS - Wow!<br/>\nEMPTY SKY - Beautiful, just beautiful. Acoustic. And cheering at the line \"I want an eye for an eye\"<br/>\nYOU'RE MISSING - Beautiful; what else can I say<br/>\nWAITIN ON A SUNNY DAY - Fantastic song to begin with - but when coupled with almost total audience participation (I think we did a lot more singing than he did), well, it just can't be beat. Uplifting and fun, fun.<br/>\nPROMISED LAND - Wow!<br/>\nWORLDS APART - I have to say I didn't like this song on the album, but it's incredible live<br/>\nBADLANDS - Wow!<br/>\nBOBBY JEAN - fantastic. Interesting that whoever was working the cameras kept focusing on Steve at key moments in the song (I found myself explaining the song to a few people)<br/>\nMARY'S PLACE - Much better live than on cd, mainly because of audience interaction - adds a whole new dimension to the song. This was also where he intro'd the band (Roy - illegitimate child of Jerry Lee Lewis and Liberace, etc.) When he got to Clarence, he mentioned that the Big Man has lost a lot of weight (sounded like he was going into \"Sweet Soul Music\" where he sings \"Doesn't Clarence look great, he's lost a lot of weight\" - but he just stopped, and looked at the audience - to see if anyone would get it?) and Clarence started to take off his jacket to show off his muscles\u2026.<br/>\nCOUNTING ON A MIRACLE - the first bathroom break of the night! People either sat down or ran for the restrooms or out to buy more beer. Not quite sure I understand that - it's not that bad a song, is it?<br/>\nAMERICAN SKIN (41 SHOTS) - Didn't hear much booing (just a couple of people); audience was fairly quiet, but the line \"you can get killed just for living in your American skin\" got some reaction.<br/>\nINTO THE FIRE - Beautiful; what else can I say<br/>\nTHUNDER ROAD - Wow!<br/>\nGLORY DAYS - he was having sooooo much fun; his smile is infectious, and this is SUCH a great song.<br/>\nBORN TO RUN - Wow!<br/>\nMY CITY OF RUINS - Bruce starts out the first couple of verses on the piano (after promoting the local food bank, etc.), and then smoothly moves over to a solo mike, no guitar. Am I the only one who thought he looked more than just a little awkward out there without a guitar? (he was dancing around near the mike, and didn't quite seem to know what to do until it was time for him to sing again) Other than that, this also had heavy audience interaction, which added quite a lot of power to it. Beautiful, as usual.<br/>\nBORN IN THE USA - Powerful as ever.<br/>\nLOHAD - as usual, magnificent, especially with the addition at the end of part of \"People Get Ready\" \u2014 why didn't he think of this during the Reunion Tour? \"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Al M.</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">I feel like I was at a different concert than the one some of you reviewed the first two nights. The setlist of old songs is not even important. This is an event on it's own terms. It's this great album we've been given and the incredible way it plays when everything is there(the arena, the crowd, and this amazing band) that is what this tour is all about. Everybody knows the songs already. This is no small feat. It is this mass hypnosis that we all would kill for that happens now, today and it is completely amazing. What an incredible song Empty Sky is done with that pain that only that voice of Bruce can generate. One guy whistled loud early in the song and I felt like 20,000 other people stared him down so you could hear a pin drop. What a moment. When he followed it with You're Missing he took us all to that place only Bruce can. Worlds Apart might be the greatest on this great album and the whole band just shows themselves here. Boy they can play. Mary's Place is an instant classic. So much fun for us and especially for the band. Waiting on a Sunny Day really kicked ass and everyone got the chorus. Bruce said common NY can you do it. It wasn't even close, they just took the song away from him. The crowd at the Garden is always half the story and tonight was no different. My wife and I went with two non Bruce fans and it was great to see their expression during the whole experience and how they just got sucked in with the rest of us. By the time we got to that first incredible set of encores, they were throwing their right arm in the air with the rest of us. I have listened to all your opinions on the end of the main set and how it breaks things up and I respectfully disagree. It was a stroke of genius putting American Skin back to back with Into the Fire. They are the two sides of the same idea, the worst and the best that, these men in uniform that we trust our live with, can be and it ties into the whole speech he gave before BITUSA where he said we need to be vigilant to keep our democracy especially in these times. What an amazing show. Thunder Road would have made you all proud with only the spotlight on Bruce and every single person up and singing along at the top of their voice. There is nothing like the Garden. The TR, GD, BTR encore is so powerful, it almost dwarfs the second encore set. The Bruce at the piano for the beginning of MCOR just plain works and it was the most beautiful version I have heard of this beautiful song. He started losing his voice during BITUSA and I'm not sure if he would have made it if the audience wasn't there to help. He almost had nothing left for LOHAD but it is the band and especially the Mandolin that carries that song. Soozie is a great addition and my wife kept talking about how Brendan O'Brien has helped them find their sound for the new millennium and how they and the show are lean and mean. No idle banter, just a straight forward vision from the mind of the Boss. It was a privilege to be at the Garden tonight.<br/>\nI was thinking that I have spent more of the greatest days of my life in that building. I saw Ali fight Frazier + Shavers there. I saw Willis Reed come out and win an NBA Championship against Chamberlain, West and the Lakers. I saw the Rangers pound Esposito, Orr Sanderson + the Bruins there. Ringling Bros Circus with Sideshow when I was a kid. I saw too many incredible nights to count of Zeppelin, and the Who and Pink Floyd, and The Moody Blues and the One to One with John Lennon. The Concert for Bangla Desh, and the subsequent Harrison tour. Dylan and the Band, the Dylan Tribute, The Muse Concerts and so many great Nights with the E St Band. Tonight stands there with any of them. It was magic and it was also the hottest ticket of the year. Don't miss this barnstorming part of the tour. I'm sure we'll all get to multiple nights to a more extended party next spring, but don't miss this early tour, It is simply great!!!!!<br/>\nAs an interesting side light, I have been humming Lets be Friends, Nothing Man and Further up the Road since I got home(the three he didn't do tonight). I guess that shows you how strong the album really is.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Ben Corrado</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">My, what a difference five days can make. After attending the opening night at the Meadowlands and the problems inherit with it, last night s show at MSG was much tighter and much more energized. Considering the set list was pretty much the same as opening night, I don t think it will be necessary to document each song, but just point out the highlights. The Fuse had a little better pace to it and fit much better into the slot between Prove It and Darkness. After again asking for the crowd to be quiet, and admonishing them with a shut up, ya bastards, albeit with a smile on his face, came Empty Sky and You re Missing. In my review of opening night, I talked about how emotional these two songs were. Now hearing them approximately twenty-five blocks from Ground Zero, they were even more poignant. In a city still hurting, each time he sang the lyric I want an eye for an eye , the audience erupted. In You re Missing, Soozie Tyrell's violin bow seemed to be dripping tears. The instrumental at the end of the song reminds me a bit of the end of Racing In The Street. Mary's Place had more zip to it. Bruce was having lots of fun with it, at one point climbing on top of the piano. This had to be how he envisioned it when he wrote it. It really had the feel of a bar band song. Switching around Thunder Road and Born to Run was a good move. The crowd singing along with Thunder Road was one of the loudest I have ever heard. Moving the two songs around even made Glory Days seem nice and fresh in the middle. Bruce and Clarence were dancing around like it was 1984 again. My City of Ruins also had a different feel to it. At the Meadowlands, he talked about Asbury Park before the song. Here, no words were necessary. Everyone knew what this song was about. After stripping down Born In The U.S.A. to the acoustic version on the last tour, going back to the full band version breathes new life into it. Finally, for LOHAD, the pogos were back!, although briefly.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I and my tour buddy Andy had planned to visit the Rock \"\"n\"\" Roll Hall of Fame, but the $17 ticket was far more than we anticipated paying, so we passed. Next time perhaps. I was surprised by how few people in town had heard about the concert. Unlike in Washington, where the local classic rock station was playing Bruce all day, and many people knew about the show, the tour really didn't seem to have descended upon the city at all. The show had apparently sold out a few days previously, but there were fans and scalpers alike trying to sell tickets outside the venue for well under face. Many ended up eating tickets, I heard a rumor which actually sounded feasible about someone selling 2 upper level tickets for 2 dollars apiece.<br/>\nBefore the show we hung out with a bunch of good Greasy Lakers, One of whom (Jacey?) had reserved a separate room at the local sports bar. This proved to be a great idea, because the bar filled up soon, but we had plenty of space to mingle and chat. If anyone is planning pre show parties at bars close to arenas at future shows, it may be a good idea to reserve a room, to avoid the kind of cramped conditions that many of us experienced at Mustang Harry's in NYC or the Childe Harold in Washington. Very nice meeting all of you guys at Flannery's BTW, I won't mention everyone by name, since I might forget someone, but it really was great to meet so many GL'ers in such a good setting. The banner, BTW looks truly amazing.<br/>\nOnto the concert; I was high up on Patti's side of the stage, where the sound was not perfect, but much better than it had been in DC (where I had comparable seats). The band came out around 8.10, and went straight into The Rising as expected. From the beginning though, it was clear that the Cleveland crowd was quite tame and suffered by comparison to the East Coast crowds at the first few shows. My section seemed to have between a quarter and two thirds of the people standing at any given time, except during the slow songs, when everyone understandably enough sat down. Certainly not everyone stood up during Badlands; and Bobby Jean saw half a dozen people in front of me get up to get beers. There were 4 very rude fans sitting right in front of me who insisted on talking loudly through much of the show despite several people asking them politely (at first) to quieten down. Finally in the middle of MCOR, the fan sitting next to me told them in no uncertain terms to shut the fuck up, and they seemed shocked enough to comply for the most part for what remained of the show. It's definitely a good thing that Bruce asks for quite before his first slow songs, but this clearly isn't enough. Perhaps a modified STFU speech would be in order? Ideally the sale of beer should also be halted once the show starts. This seemed to work very well in Pittsburgh on the last tour. I heard from many other fans who thought the crowd was fine, but from where I was looking, the upper levels especially, were less into the show than at the three first concerts of the tour.<br/>\nThe songs continue to grow and develop, and the improvement curve so early in the tour is great to watch from show to show. I may be wrong, but I think I remember that Suzie did not play a solo at the end of Worlds Apart at this show. Certainly, Bruce's churning ever-lengthening guitar solo dominated the terrific musical finish to that song. Nils's solo at the End of The Fuse also continues to change a little each night, and was a highlight of the song. I thought the performance in general was tight, but not extraordinarily spirited. I sensed that Bruce was playing hard, but ultimately wasn't inspired to one of his truly superhuman performances. A review of the show the next day in a local paper gave a generally favorable, but non-raving account of the show.<br/>\nThe setlist remained exactly the same for the third night in a row. Unlike the NYC and DC shows the setlist didn't work so well with a less attentive audience, many of whom were scampering around for beer during Into the Fire. With a less fired up audience, the limitations of the setlist became more apparent. By the time he had finished Mary's Place, the crowd was just about in his grasp, and if there had been enough flexibility in the set to throw in a more familiar song next, the crowd might well have been won over for good. But the last three songs of the main set, while individually very powerful, bring the crowd down after the euphoria of Mary's place, without bringing it up again. I can understand that after playing Mary's Place, the band isn't able to maintain that high tempo intensity. But a more familiar, lighter song would work much better instead of the intense still-obscure Countin' on a Miracle. Bobby Jean perhaps?<br/>\nThe highlight of the show for me was undoubtedly the encores, which finally saw the not-quite-full Gund Arena up and rocking at full tilt. Thunder Road is still sounding fine, the band seems to be having even more fun than the audience during the rambunctious Glory Days and BTR never fails to please everyone. The second encore is more serious without being too depressing; rousing without allowing itself to be mistaken as overtly patriotic. Certainly, playing the full band BUSA again is treading a fine line, but so far the song seems to work very well indeed. The spooky muted green lighting during BUSA is very effective in helping to convey the dark nature of the song. LoHaD is building muscle, sounding as good as it did on the last tour.<br/>\nAfter seeing the first 3 east coast shows, I found Cleveland to be a little disappointing, because of the comparatively tame audience. If this turns out to be the typical 2002 tour crowd, the set is in all the more need for some drastic overhaul in order for it to be all it can be. When I go to a rock show, I expect the audience to give all the attention and enthusiasm it has to enjoying an participating in the performance. But I also expect the performer (especially one as professional as Bruce) to be able to gauge the audience, and know just when to throw in an unplanned song or two, to take advantage of the of the crowd's excitement at essential points in the show. Right now, the setlist seems to me imperfectly paced and too rigid.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I thought it was better than the 2 shows here during the reunion tour 3 years ago. Even though it was only 2.5 hours, there was an awesome electricity to the place. It was a phenomenal concert, it was great to see Bruce play stuff from the rising, especially you're missing, that was such an emotional song. People around me had tears in their eyes. Glory Days, Born In The USA, Born to Run were tremendous. If you haven't seen Bruce on this tour, you are missing out people.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Magnus</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">It was my 23rd show, and while I had seen the ESB 19 times before, I had never been very close to the stage. But my tour buddy Andy was able to trade his way to a pair of GAs for Detroit, and we were determined to make the most of the tickets and try to get as close to the stage, within the coveted \"first 300\". We arrived at the arena around noon with another friend, where we found the dropline and were able to sign on as numbers 51 to 53. There were numerous problems with the arena staff. Clearly some arenas have no experience with handling even small groups of fans before the afternoon of an event, and the staff at the Palace were both incompetent and unpleasant to deal with. They continuously changed their \"policy\", and asked for bribes to allow us into their empty parking lot before 4pm, while we were gathered by the side of a highway outside the arena. Before being wristbanded, we had to sign some kind of waiver form (which no one was given time to read time to read), that probably said something about us taking responsibility for any injury which might incur in what they called the \"mosh pit\". Once we got into the arena at around 6pm, the staff were more helpful, and did their best to honor our drop list, but they weren't great at showing us just how to get to the floor, which resulted in a mad dash around an unfamiliar arena. Big thank you's go out to Ted and Todd for running the dropline so effectively and fairly. We were able to move in and out of the dropline pretty freely, and tailgate with other fans. Everyone seemed to be trying to sell extra tickets for under face, generally unsuccessfully. I didn't even see any scalpers outside the arena at all. It was nice meeting RyanCoke and AlanSorrells w. wives before the show, and truly great to later experience the show together with Alan and his wife Angel.<br/>\nFinally we got to the floor, and after seeing so many shows from nosebleed seats, I couldn't quite believe that I was so close to the stage. We ended up 2nd row between Patti and Steve, and I just knew the show was going to be a new kind of experience. After experiencing the disappointing Cleveland crowd from upper tier seats, I was glad to be close to the stage, where I figured the fans would be rocking all night. Before the show, people were sitting down on the floor, and had time to go for bathroom breaks and such, without too many problems.<br/>\nI can't quite see why so many people are pissed off with the GA system. No longer do you need to luck through with TM or be pretty and get MIB'ed to get up close. It just a matter or early bird get's the f**king worm. We were among the first to get to the show, and among the closest fans to the stage. There really wasn't much of a crush in front of the stage, except when Bruce came along the very edge of the stage a few times, and everyone surged forward to touch him. There weren't really any bad episodes to speak of at the front, except one over-excited man who shouted loud out to Patti right after Bruce had asked for quiet. He was shushed promptly by fans around him, but later got a smile from Patti (and a joking admission from Bruce) with a better time shout of; \"Patti we love you!\" One man next to me seemed very intent on keeping a larger than necessary area clear around his girlfriend or wife, who was in the front row. It is great to be so close to the stage, but people, this is a rock 'n' roll show. If you can't stand to wait outside in line for a whole day, and then be kind of pressed up against other sweaty fans for a couple of hours, maybe you should go for reserved seat instead. I know I wouldn't have taken a young child to the very front myself. Not because anyone really wanted to push forward at other people's expense, but it did get just a little bit stifling at times. Just like a rock show should be.<br/>\nSeeing a show from the \"front lines\" is such a different experience, and I really can't recommend it enough to anyone who hasn't tried it yet. Aside from the obvious fact that you are right at the feet of the band, the sound quality is stellar. It was pretty much like listening to a Crystal Cat bootleg, although that might conceivably change if you are far out on one of the wings. The only sound problem I remember was that I still couldn't hear Steve's mandolin during Glory Days, and I still couldn't really hear the playful exchange between him and Bruce towards the end of that song (it was actually only at the NJ show on 8/7 that I could make out what they were saying). I can't comment on the sound quality or \"audience quality\" in the rest of the arena, but I heard that the audience was comparable to the one in Cleveland; around 85% capacity, and not quite as into the show as the east coast crowds were. But in front of the stage for 2 and a half hours, that mattered little to me.<br/>\nIf you are able to get in among the first 300 or so, you get close enough to the band to see little details that get lost or overlooked on the video screens. Their facial expressions, the little interactions bandmembers have with one other. You notice what they are doing when the spotlight isn't on them. I never realized that Garry and Patti were so animated. Patti especially seemed to be having a great time playing, and she is being utilized so much better on this tour than the last one. Bruce seemed to be in great spirits, and looked like he was having a terrific time playing. I could see how he fed off the energy of the front rows just from watching his eyes sparkle with excitement as he belted played the harmonica solo to Promised Land.<br/>\nThere's one more thing you can't quite appreciate without seeing it up front: Bruce sweats bucketloads. That headband he used to wear in the 80s wasn't just for show. By the time he was ripping into Prove it, his shirt was darkening, and his arms were already glistening. By the time he played Worlds Apart, he was as soaked as if he had just jumped into a pool, and the sweat was dripping off him and his guitar constantly. Towards the end of the song, when he began clapping his hands above his head in time with Max's drumming, you could see cloud of perspiration every time he brought his hands together. I knew that Bruce put 110% of his energy into his performances, but I had never really witnessed it up close like this, and just seeing him work so hard gave me a whole new appreciation for just how much of himself he puts into entertaining 20\u00a0000 fans each night. Experiencing a show so close up was a very physical experience, both because I was really getting into the show myself, and because I was watching Bruce working himself up 10 times harder than anyone in the audience. I've been in the army, I've worked in moving companies, working through hot Virginia summers, and I've seen Clarence Clemmons play at the Stone Pony, but I have never seen anyone sweat as much, or work so hard as Bruce did right there in front of me.<br/>\nThe performance seemed electrifying to me, and while it is impossible to objectively compare this show to the others I saw from nosebleeds, I was able to identify a couple of highlights of the show. Worlds Apart is a powerhouse performance and just gets better every night; and Bruce's guitaring at the end is up there with the guitar solo that ends Prove it (or Because the Night back in '78). Mary's Place was really loose and fun, and opened with a few choice lines from Dancing in the Street; the reference to the Motor City getting roars of excitement from the Detroit audience. It was a great moment, the kind of little detail that the show needs more of. Whether planned or not, it was a nice touch which injected some freshness into an otherwise predictable setlist. It also left me hungering for a certain medley in the encores, which I suppose Bruce decided not to play for his own reasons.<br/>\nBy the time the show ended, with a typically high energy encore set, I was drained. I hadn't been so tired after a show, since after my first ever ESB show from the last tour. Just looking at the faces around me as the arena emptied out was a thrill in and of itself. Seeing Bruce put on a show from that close up is something special, and every true fan deserves the chance to experience it for themselves.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I had wondered how early to arrive for a decent location on the arena floor. even with this late arrival to avoid the heat, choice spots were still available on the floor in the center about halfway back. FYI, THE GA TICKETS ARE THE WAY TO GO TO THESE SHOWS, NOT THAT MANY ARE SOLD AND THE FLOOR IS NOT CROWDED\u2026<br/>\nmy friend commented on the late arriving crowd and whether the show would indeed be sold out. the guy next to us responded that \"it should be, Bruce only has the number one album in twelve countries\u2026.\" he was from Austin and about my age and a hardcore fan. we compared our show histories and the conflicted emotions about Bruce's reclaimed media spotlight versus longtime fan's support.<br/>\nThis was only the second Las Vegas performance in Bruce's 30 plus year career. the band took the stage shortly past eight, all members looking sharp. Bruce was wearing a blue silk shirt open about halfway with a silver saint Christopher around his neck, sleeves rolled up. The black Levi's and boots completed Bruce's outfit, and he WAS wearing the wedding ring at this show. Bruce has dropped the extra weight he showed in the reunion tour a couple years ago.<br/>\nthe local alternative paper in Vegas had carried a great cover story written by magician Penn Jillette (of Penn and Teller). Penn's article had postulated that Bruce's appeal resulted from the fact that fans could imagine that they really WERE Bruce Springsteen rather than dreaming what it would be like to be some other rock star. this blue collar everyman appeal, coupled with his massive talent, really is an irresistible combination.<br/>\nBruce shouted early in the show: \"do you feel lucky las Vegas?? (pause) do you feel lucky las Vegas???\u2026. did I fire six shots, or only five????\" lol<br/>\nThe setlist was about the same as Bruce has been playing on this tour: the 11 songs from The Rising, he nuggets from Darkness\u2026., three songs from Born In The USA (including Bobby Jean), a couple from Born to Run, closing with Land of Hope and Dreams.<br/>\nThe new songs were received wonderfully by the crowd, which included a nice mix of older boomers and lots of younger fans. the sept. 11 inspired acoustic songs at the beginning are powerful, especially Empty Sky (great harmonica break) The Fuse is not my favorite, but it was performed well and probably will remain in the show\u2026.<br/>\nthe \"Waiting on a sunny day\" singalong really is fun. Mary's Place is GREAT!!! the band intro's are great: \"Seigfried and Roy got nothing on clarence\") and the singalong refrain led by Bruce: \"I drop the needle and pray\u2026. turn it up!\" was a pleasure to behold. How Bruce wrote such a happy sounding song about recovering from great loss is a wonder.<br/>\nThe surprise of the evening was Bruce's rendition of \"Viva Las Vegas\" he started out in the wrong key and made a funny comment to the crowd that that should have been sorted out at the sound check. after then placing a capo on the telecaster, and commented that the song might sound better in its proper key of B, it was a rousing version that would have made the King proud. Little Stevie wrapped a pair of pink foam dice around the neck of Bruce's guitar for the second half of the song and at the climax, Bruce gave them a big round up and tossed them way out onto the floor into a lucky fan's outstretched hands\u2026 I wonder if Bruce learned this song just for this show. I like to think so\u2026.<br/>\nBruce moved nicely all over the stage, up on the piano and drum stand at various points. he played nicely to the folks behind the stage too, making a point to wave a couple times to two young girls, about 10 and 5 years old, in the rear front row.<br/>\nBruce didn't talk much, limiting his comments mostly to promoting the Clark county food bank and a nice comment about the recent encroachments on our civil liberties and to remain vigilant in a good intro into born in the USA. a great way to segue into this often misappropriated song. LOHAD was super and the show was over, two and a half hours after it had begun. no one was disappointed, I assure you.<br/>\nAfterwards, my lady friend and I drove over to the hard rock hotel and casino, where the band had been staying along with Leo DiCaprio, Christian Slater, and Robert Downey jr. we missed seeing any celebrities, but I did make a small profit at blackjack before we called it a night\u2026 all in all, a great time was had\u2026</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Kevon McDevitt</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">I am going to do a comparison. A(ny) Reunion Tour show vs. New Jersey '02 vs. Las Vegas '02. Like many, I loved the RT. Like many, I was very disappointed in the opening show at the Meadowlands. Part of that was my fault; I went in looking for a repeat of the RT show with cuts from the new album thrown in. I was really let down at that show\u2026not just by the setlist, but by the lack of enthusiasm and cohesion. Heck, even the intros of the band members were lame. FLASH to Las Vegas. 200% improvement. The band was into it, obviously feeling more comfortable in their new \"clothes\". Granted, I was not expecting much coming off the NJ show, as well as seeing the \"uniformity\" of the setlists (night after night after night\u2026) but Hey!, he did play Viva Las Vegas, and there's a bit of a new six-pack with Sunny Day-Promised Land-Worlds Apart-Badlands-Bobby Jean-Mary's Place. Two of the biggest problems of the show, however, are The Fuse and Counting On A Miracle. Both songs seem to slam the brakes on the building momentum. But all-in-all, a superior show to NJ. Just don't go in expecting a Reunion Tour show.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I am going to Tacoma tonight so I got to make this rather short and sweet. Well, my friend was right about a change coming in the setlist in Portland. Fantastic version of Backstreets added as well as a Reunion Tour style Atlantic City. I got down to Portland about 4:00 p.m., grabbed a parking slot for $13 and headed over to check out the Rose Garden, which is located just off I-5.<br/>\nThere were about 200 people in one line winding around the facility, and about the same in another line. I had reserved tickets, so I headed straight to the elevator and the fourth floor to hear the soundcheck and they were already at it. I knew that you could hear it from a certain spot crystal clear so I didn't bother with anything else. It did not disappoint. Three songs were the primary work: Dancing in the Dark, Atlantic City, and Backstreets. Dancing in the Dark is very well developed and ready to go Tacoma or Los Angeles, my guess.<br/>\nThey also played a ton of short odd pieces that I couldn't make out what it was. I doubt a new non-Rising song, so maybe just part of the soundcheck. But the soundcheck went long and they delayed letting people in the stadium because it ran over. Because I had reserved seats, I then ambled down to the first floor, out the door, and over to the entranceway, gave my ticket, and headed in. The Rose Garden was slow to fill up and we got a good dose of Little Steven's Underground Garage, which was great but 2 plus hours of doo wop did start to get to me by the end. Had a funny conversation with the guy sitting above me who informed me that Patty called the shots and whatever the setlist was would be her call. That since Bruce married her, she makes all the decisions, and that if it were him he'd let her know who the real boss was. The guy was tanked and kind of funny. Hey, it passes the time and it was either him or the Underground Garage. I think we got started about 8:15 Oregon time.<br/>\nThe Garden was about 90 percent full, but it is hard to tell because the GA was only about half full, but it definitely was not a sellout. But it wasn't empty by any stretch either. Bruce came out in all black and wearing his haven't shaved or bathed in a couple days look. The band was in great form, and many of the issues others have spoken about I didn't really notice. The sound is turned up a decibal compared to the Reunion Tour and this concert definitely highlights Bruce much more. He takes almost all the guitar solos and is much more serious than Reunion. Not nearly the interplay with band members and very little conversation. He didn't say anything other than Hello Portland until right before Empty Sky when he said, \"\"Hello Portland. It's a nice little place. A nice little spot. I spent a night here once.\"\" Then he just started giggling uncontrollably and finally looked over at Patty and said, \"\"What was I thinking'\"\" The reference was obviously to marriage one which took place of course in a Portland sub.<br/>\nThe sound was great but a little loud for my taste. There was feedback two or three times but nothing that took away from the show. Backstreets was awesome; no 41 Shots or Darkness; but I am not one to quibble over setlist. Born in the USA was awesome; Glory Days spectacular. MCOR: what can I say; a real gem of a song. Bruce gave his food bank pitch and mentioned that our civil rights were being eroded, which I think he has done at other shows. Those that thought Bruce had the eye for Soozie couldn't be more wrong; he and Patty showed great chemistry and at the end of the show, Soozie and Patty walked down the stairs arm in arm. I will say that Nils and Garry now make up kind of a back row of simply playing while Clarence, Bruce, and Steve make up the core of the interaction. No major solos for Nils either. But he seemed happy for those wondering.<br/>\nOverall, it is a different show than Reunion, a lot less interplay among the band, much more Bruce, the new songs aren't quite as layered and textured as the old stuff, of course, but they'll get there. Well, I am ready to head to bed; post tomorrow morning after Tacoma with another review. I bet they add Dancing in the Dark, unless they get to bed too late themselves and decide to hold off until L.A. I'm out. I'm not proofreading this, so hope it's coherent.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Michael West</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">The Professor meandered onto the stage at approximately 8.20pm, the first of the band members to enter the Rose Garden proper. The rest of the group followed close behind with Bruce bringing up the rear and, naturally, receiving the biggest ovation. I had 200-level reserved seats on the Big Man's side, and rose with a tear in my eye to applaud them all. Personally, I wouldn't have minded standing for the entire show, but as The Rising began people around me started to take their seats again so I followed suit.<br/>\nMy immediate impression of the concert was that the mix was too muddy. Perhaps this was simply due to my position, as the arena itself is fantastic and I'm assuming has great acoustics. Regardless, at this point Gary's bass was 'wobbly', Bruce's vocals were a touch overpowering and I would have liked Max to be more prominent. These technical problems slightly shadowed my enjoyment of the opening song, but my eyes showed me that the intensity from everyone was present from the very off. The band shifted into Lonesome Day with a nice segue, and although the sound wasn't perfect for this number either, I was delighted to see Bruce's body language at this point. He was positively brimming with passion and energy. For my money, Bruce was the show's MVP by an astronomical distance. For a man of his age, the amount of zest and punch he had from start to finish was breathtaking. Not only that, but I struggle to recall when I've ever seen him in such a good mood! Broad smiles, belly laughs and more besides. A far cry from the 'serious' figure of earlier shows.<br/>\nThey transitioned into Prove It All Night without the customary count-in from Bruce, and this garnered a decent enough reaction from the gathered throng. The mix was noticeably improving at this juncture. One of my (admittedly VERY minor) quibbles about the show was the overall lack of participation on the crowd's part. Yes, the house was only around 75% full (lots of blacked-out front and rear 300-level seats) but those present were still too subdued for my tastes. Additionally, it didn't appear that many folks around my section were overly familiar with the new material. On the bright side, at least they didn't talk all over it! I thought that Prove It started off relatively slow, but picked up speed at a rate of knots. Bruce busted out a KICK-ASS solo as the song neared conclusion, his face scrunched up tight and body contorting with the effort and concentration. It is always a pleasure to watch the Mighty One get completely carried away in this moment, crashing those drums as though his very life depended on it. This was one of many highlights for the night, and as Bruce and Max cast their magic spell the audience began to stand around me, expecting another upbeat track to truly blow the roof off. So, following up with The Fuse proved to be somewhat of an atmosphere dampener. The folks who'd taken more time to warm-up and get into it immediately sat down again. I actually really enjoyed the live performance of this song, and it received very warm applause. It's a very 'deliberate' song (if that makes any sense), and I didn't find myself wanting to throttle Patti 'I normally sound like a hyperactive rodent base freak' Scialfa, which is practically a first. However, I do feel that it gave the show an odd momentum at this early stage. Nil's solo, in an otherwise quiet show for him where he looked quite bored at times, was excellent. Great to see Bruce sidling up next to him, nodding his head and repeatedly saying 'come on' as the Trampoline Man wailed away.<br/>\nUp next was a tour debut! After religiously reading the (predominantly static) set-lists for the previous shows, it had been drummed into my thick skull that Darkness On The Edge Of Town would be in this slot. No questions asked. So, when Max started laying down a different beat it didn't even register with me for a couple of seconds. Then I got to thinking if they had completely altered the arrangement'! After my initial shock had subsided I called it as Atlantic City, and found myself thinking that I'd been very lucky just to get to hear this. I believe that it does fit thematically and musically in this slot, and is an excellent track to rotate in-and-out when Bruce desires. The performance itself was very similar to the last tour's versions. Bruce sang certain sections a little differently, hitting higher and drawing out certain phrases. If I'm going to be overly critical I'd say it sounded a tiny bit rusty, but this didn't make a mark on my Enjoyment Radar by any stretch.<br/>\nBruce spoke to the crowd before the somber section of the show, asking for some quiet. He went on to talk about how he'd got married here before and that he thought it was a nice place. Realizing his error, he looked across to Patti and said words to the effect of 'whoops, I'm in the shit now!'. He drew this out for quite some time, to laughter all around, making it the closest thing to a true speech that he's delivered for a while. Empty Sky was another huge plus point of the show. Hauntingly beautiful and much improved over a now plodding and pedestrian album cut. Bruce and Patti harmonized superbly, with The Boss himself in SUPERB vocal form. The look on his face showed how deep he was digging, and he struck gold with a range I don't believe I've ever heard escape him before. Compared to what I thought were very mediocre vocals on the Reunion Tour, it was like witnessing a different person. You're Missing followed, one of my favorites from the album. In concert I feel it is even better. Delicate and touching but still poignant and powerful at the same time, with the everyday lyrics bringing home the reality of true loss. Thankfully, Max isn't as high in the mix as he is on the album, letting the violin, piano and organ do their work masterfully. As The Phantom sees the song home, Springsteen turns away from the crowd to direct him with repeated gestures with his left index finger. I thought Soozie played flawlessly all evening, and her influence on You're Missing had me crying like a crack-whore in a strictly no soliciting zone.<br/>\nWaitin' On A Sunny Day was great, and served well in picking up the audience and the mood. Bruce was particularly active, stalking the stage with his presence and encouraging participation, a la Hungry Heart. The crowd did sing it with him, but compared to how this part had gone on the East Coast it must have been considered disappointing overall. Deafening it wasn't. The Promised Land hit next. I thought it started off pretty sluggishly, and it was becoming quite apparent that the new material was being performed 100% better than a lot of the old warhorses. It had more energy, more weight, more punch. More everything. To those who complain about the sets without having seen a show, wait 'til you catch one. To those who complain after having seen a show, I suggest you stop living in the past. It's sad. Getting back to the show itself, the Big Man nailed his solo, as he did practically everything all night. I was very impressed with him and he was my #2 MVP behind Bruce. Always smiling, and his weight loss has him being much more active these days. Every crowd loves him to pieces. Little Steven's solo didn't exactly blow me away, nor did any other work from him.<br/>\nOk, World's Apart. Let me start by saying that I really like the album version a great deal. However, I thought the live version was, overall, a muddy mess. I know the song has great potential but, right now for me, it really does not cut the mustard. To begin with, the intro is nice but too long. Instead of grabbing your attention and holding it, the song begins to meander away from you. Bruce gets very into it at the song's beginning, leaning backwards with his eyes closed, swaying almost imperceptibly. The middle section is ok but the band don't exactly sound well-oiled. There's no separation of the instruments and they seem to blend together in an unspectacular fashion. If they're trying to mould it into a show-stopper they're shit out of luck at the moment. Steve needs to either learn his solo or lose it, as it essentially goes nowhere. Fast. Bruce's solo, like Steve's, is too long and I was struggling to fathom any real pattern or tune to the playing. That aside, I fucking LOVE this track live. Leaves Incident dying in the dirt.<br/>\nTransitioned straight into Badlands, and if I'm being perfectly honest, I was a little under whelmed with it. The versions we saw for The River and BITUSA tours are long gone now. It got the crowd animated, but like the other Darkness tracks took some time to fully kick into life. Though, having said that, I did find a tear in my eye with the 'I believe in the love you gave me'' section, for no better reason than it is exceptional writing and seeing it live is mind-blowing. This led straight into Bobby Jean. Whatever you think about this song, it DOES fit thematically (at least, a damn sight better than Two Hearts). First time I'd seen it since the Tunnel tour, when I was only seven years old. Always loved the song and cried all the way through it. Got a nice enough pop when it kicked in and the crowd seemed to enjoy it. Sure, it wasn't the most flawless performance of the song I've ever seen, but I am pleased to report that the Big Man nailed his solo (something he didn't do with great regularity on the last tour' er, with anything really).<br/>\nMary's Place followed. I loved this, but it wasn't without its flaws. I can't help feeling that Bruce brings it to a halt it too many times for the crowd to really grab hold of some momentum and run with it. Bruce was up on the piano at one stage, next to the Big Man. As he jumped down he knocked into Soozie, which brought smiles from both of them. The band introductions were relatively sparse. I thought the blue lighting that washes over the floor to accompany the 'Let it rain' lines was a very nice touch, and Bruce's lamentation of 'I've been missing you' was beautiful. An emotional moment. Countin' On A Miracle, by way of contrast, was uninspired and, in my opinion, adds absolutely nothing to a generic Bruce-by-numbers album cut. I'd like to see this song receive a SIGNIFICANT makeover (acoustic') or be replaced by one of the four other album tracks that are not currently in the set. If they want a rocker in this slot, why not opt for Further On Up The Road' Better track, and still serves the purpose of promoting the new material. Same goes for World's Apart if that doesn't improve.<br/>\nFully expected 41 Shots to be the next song, which would have been great with me as I really rate it. However, was practically knocked out of my seat when Roy started Backstreets! Another tour debut and I literally couldn't believe it. Turns out that it was sound checked earlier in the day and was a last minute audible shouted out from Bruce. Being perfectly honest, I had tears running down my face for the entire song and can only really remember adoring every second of it. The one thing that stood out as different to the Reunion version was Bruce's delivery at the very end. Instead of the usual multiple moans we got a higher pitched more yodel-like emission. I mouthed a silent 'thank you' to the band at the end, which kinda says it all really. Into The Fire had a nice extended intro which kicked into a superb version. At THIS POINT in time I wasn't convinced as to its placement as set closer.<br/>\nThunder Road opened the encores, and far from Bruce closing his eyes and mumbling his way through it, he was actually wearing a big smile across his lips and was really into it. There was a hint of twang early on but it didn't last long enough to become annoying. Indeed, compared to how he ritually SLAYED it with some horrendous versions on the last tour, this was like a breath of fresh air. Yes, it was played slower than is ideal and was a mite pedestrian, but the second half was really fun, the crowd lap it up every time and I guess I'd rather see it than not. Glory Days was, to my great surprise, fantastic. Never really been a fan of either album or live versions before, but the house band brought it to life and it seemed fresh and fun. Most of the band members were patrolling all over the stage, paying close attention to the rear seats and getting everyone back there pumped up. Lots of silly faces and daft dancing, with Bruce and Clarence shaking their booties at the lip of the stage! Born To Run, as always, got the biggest ovation of the evening. Played with the house lights up, this was an excellent version. Thought it might have been played a TOUCH too slow but this is being overly pedantic really. Found myself crying for the 'Someday girl, I don't know when'' part, which is probably my favorite line of all-time.<br/>\nMy City Of Ruins got the second encore underway. Bruce started out on piano for the first verse before handing the reigns back to Roy. Once again, another superb performance of a song from the new album. Born In The USA was preceded with the short speech about the rolling back of civil liberties. No over-the-top count-in from Bruce was the first indicator that he was not going to have this song misunderstood like it was back in 84/85. He didn't want it to be a celebration, so let's not get the crowd into it before its even begun. First impressions was that the song seemed darker, angrier, dirtier and moodier then before. This before Bruce had sung a single line. It sounded fabulous. It is sung markedly differently to the full band versions we've heard before. Bruce delivers a pace where you can't QUITE shout along at the top of your lungs and pump your fist. I thought this was a great ploy. At least it saved me from a potential dumb-ass jingoistic fuck ruining the song for me. No scream from Bruce but some VERY cool guitar work. Again, worked to immense results in tandem with Max, who absolutely OWNS this song. The segue into Land Of Hope And Dreams was a touch rough but the song itself was excellent. Seemed to be played a little bit quicker than the last tour. Bruce's facial expressions and delivery of the 'People Get Ready' there's a train coming' lines was worth the admission fee alone. It's the one image that continually returns to me when I think of this show.<br/>\nSo, in conclusion I guess' The show length is ABSOLUTELY FINE. Nigh-on perfect I'd go as far as saying. Doesn't seem like 'only' 2 hours 30 minutes. Again, for the losers who have been complaining about the show length without actually GOING to the concert, your parents have my sympathy. The band was VERY tight for this early in the tour. Surprisingly tight, I thought. Personally, I'd like the pacing of the show to be looked at a little bit. It has an undulating momentum in my opinion. In hindsight, with my shows arriving very early on in the tour I wish I'd had the willpower to stay away from reading the set lists. I'm thankful I didn't know any of the arrangements for the material that was offered up, but can't help feeling that the overall excitement factor would have been higher for me. The price you pay for being a fanatic, I guess. At THIS POINT I would have liked another hard rocker to close after LOHAD. Overall, an absolutely AWESOME show, marred only marginally due to a pretty quiet crowd and less-than-perfect acoustics in my section. Absolutely one of the best shows I've ever seen. I'd pay double the admission fee to see it.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

All shows have had amazing moments, especially the early shows when the element of surprise was always around the corner.This show was paced a little and I could sense a little routine in the setlist.But then, as always, I was blown away by what could only be described as a \"4 song rock n roll twister\" that blew the whole house down! Your setlist has an error, it is missing Born to Run after Ramrod! Back to how this show blew me and evidently 14,000 other folks clean away! It started out quite subdued with the haunting song Into the Fire, which was a very personal song for me as my Father was a Fifefighter, then the band left the stage with the crowd in a very reflective mood, like the boss can do better than any musician alive, when they retuned, maybe 2 minutes later for the encore, total joy and mayhem ensued with the 1st surprise of the nite, a full tilt cranked up electric \"Dancin' in the Dark\" then the 2nd surprise and soul rush came \"Ramrod\" rockin' Loud and Proud! This audience, and I mean to the last row, out in the popcorn stands, down at the parking lot was shaking it's collective ass!This show all of sudden harkened all of us back to the best shows ever! Now the best part of this 4 song mindblower comes, I've heard this song live at every show,But never, let me repaet this for the skeptics, NEVER, as full tilt wild wrecklessly over the edge as 8/21/02, Born to Run at a 100% intensity! Hey these 4 songs were better than any drug I've ever tried friends, if you got the cash, see this tour, G.A. is the way to go Thaqnk You for hearing me out, I feel better</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Johnny</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">First off let me say that this was SO MUCH BETTER THAN PORTLAND THAT IT MAKES PORTLAND SEEM LIKE A WARMUP SHOW. Tacoma came through AND I MEAN CAME THROUGH BIG TIME. This crowd was into it two hours before the show started and never stopped. Nobody sat down around the whole arena virtually the entire show; the floor was 2/3 full and dynamite all night long; the band just didn't quit. You could tell Bruce saw the difference from Portland before he ever came out because he was SO MUCH MORE INTO IT TONIGHT THAN LAST NIGHT THAT IT IS ALMOST LIKE SEEING TWO DIFFERENT ACTS. This band is hitting on all cylinders now, and I mean ALL cylinders. It was no let up start to finish. The Dome was very full, but they had taken out the furthest seats and curtained it off and some of the back side seats had tarps over them and weren't used, but it really made a very intimate setting and everybody seemed to just converge, sides, floor, and all from the beginning. Setlist changes included the soundchecked Dancing in the Dark from last night and Ramrod, and both were upgrades from Atlantic City and Backstreets, although barely from Backstreets. Dancing in the Dark was the best I've ever heard it. Soozie adds so much on this song that it's unbelievable. Ramrod just blew the house away, like it did on Reunion, and was perfect. No Glory Days, but Bruce was one second away after the last encore from going for it; everybody just kept going nuts and he and the band just stood there forever saying thanks Tacoma that this had to be the best show of the Tour so far, you could just tell by the entire bands' reaction. But it gets better. Faith will be rewarded. After the show about 75 fans waited outside for Bruce to come out to get in a van for a motorcycle police escort to the airport, and he ambled on over for us and signed autographs for about 3 or 4 minutes. We were on one side of a fence and you had to hand stuff over for him. I didn't have anything to be signed so my wife and I just took it in seeing him. Came out in old coat, jeans, and baseball cap. He didn't say a word the entire time, just signed quickly and randomly for a few minutes, turned around and got in the waiting van, and off they went. First time I had seen him face to face and dude he is one little guy; I mean skinny and short if you haven't seen him that intimately before; kinda surprised me and my wife. But did that make our night. It doesn't get any better than this. Well, I'm out.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

The band is as tight as I've ever seen it, and Suzie Tyrell's violin adds an even richer, more textured feel to the E Street's sounds. Atlantic City is heartbreaking, and Born in the USA is downright bone-chilling. I've been waiting my entire life to hear him play that song electric. Springsteen is the greatest live performer in rock and roll history, and tonight was further proof of that fact.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Will Rumble</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">What can I say, I'm still buzzing from the natural high I got from creating, with the fans and the band, that soul soaring celebration of life we all know and love. It started in the parking lot when we rolled in at about noon. Maybe 300 people at most, no Meadowlands mind you, but some scene. Loose Ends blaring loudly from some monster SUV welcomed us warmly so I knew everything was gonna be alright.<br/>\nThe fans had set up this system for GA holders where you sign a clipboard, give 'em your name, and they write a number on your hand. Bruce freaks and geeks? Maybe, but hey, it worked and it was fair. We got numbers 315-317 so with only 300 allowed into the pit, at least we would be right at the front of the railing dividing the pit from the rest of the floor. We checked back in every hour, and wouldn't you know it, by 5:30, thirty or so had dropped out so we become part of the 300 and made it to the pit. They took us down into the depths of the Forum, and you end up in a hall way that turns into the Forum floor, very cool. I had woke up that day with such an excitement, and then to walk on the floor like that - out of the this world.<br/>\nWe get down there in the pit and 300 people is nothing - there was so much room down there. It was awesome. I got right in front of Bruce's mic-stand, 10 feet away. Just amazing. They let us in at 6:00 p.m., so almost everyone was sitting down until about 7:30 - 7:45 and then we all got up as the anticipation began to rise.<br/>\nSo the lights go off and the band comes out at about 8:25 and I was going nuts. As soon as they started to play it was like an Avalanche of energy coming straight into my heart. The Rising just ROCKS and Bruce was jamming on guitar. For me, it was the best beginning to a Bruce show I have experienced in a long, long time. And it kept coming. He doesn't do that dream of life thing anymore and the band was tight and they went into Lonesome Day seamlessly. That song doesn't do much for me on the album, but live it was great. There's not the weak bridge in the middle of the song that is on the album. Prove it was great, and Bruce did have a Fender-looking guitar, although I'm not sure. It was definitely not the one we all know and Stuart touched and talked to Bruce about at the Tramps show filmed by Disney. Anyway, great song. The Fuse was cool, it fit perfectly in that slot, and it was tight.<br/>\nAtlantic City kicked butt. It was totally re-done and was the best Atlantic City I've ever scene. I saw it in 84, 85, and 99. It smoked. He did this build up at the end that kept on getting louder and louder with the fans singing along. He just connected so much with the fans on that song, and for the entire show for that matter. A great rocker that he was so into.<br/>\nHe asked for, politely, and received, quite for Sky/Missing. Those two are one of the highlights of the show - the thing about this show was that he really was into the new songs, and most of the older ones. You can tell, he really likes this album - he should. Sunny Day was great. You can't help but think of Hungary Heart, and he really got the fans going on this one. Everyone had acoustic guitars and came to the front and back of the stage - he played to the back 3 or 4 times - more than MSG 6/29/00!! He went through the front of the stage and got high fives/touching hands during Sunny Day - it worked. Promised land was awesome and I wish he would throw those harmonicas to the fans like he used to.<br/>\nThe show started to lose some energy and intensity with Worlds Apart, which I love. He did a great guitar duel with Steven at the end that was almost like the old Saint duels - almost. Badlands, Bobby Jean, and Thunder Road for me, don't work for this tour. I know \"I'll miss you, good luck, good bye\" of BJ fits with what he's doing, but they played it w/o the juice that the rest of the show had flowed with up to that point. It is almost like Badlands, Bobby Jean, and Thunder Road are obligatory old songs to mix in with the new ones. If he wants a rocker, why not play Further on Up the Road at that point of show?<br/>\nMary's place I love, but there were so many stops and starts during the song, it symbolized the loss of tempo songs 11 - 16 frustrated the rest of the show with.<br/>\nCounting on a Miracle? How does Bruce go from \"I ain't gonna settle for the in-betweens, honey I want your heart, your soul, I want control\" of Badlands to \"Fairytale \u2026 Counting on a miracle to see me through\" of Miracle? That song reminds me of some human touch outtake that should have been left on the cutting room floor. Why not play Nothing Man or Paradise, two great Rising songs?<br/>\nThe show picked up again with Into the Fire, which is a great set closer. Awesomely placed, and a wonderful vision that succinctly sums up The Rising. I loved it as a show closer.<br/>\nThe Encores Rocked. Let me tell, The Speed Guitar Rocking Version of Dancing in the Dark played like a song that had been recorded during the River and had been locked away as a song that didn't make it on Tracks but came screaming out of the Columbia vaults to blast us off our feet at the Forum. That version smoked!! It is not surprising that the River's Ram Rod followed - what a great two River Rockers back to back. Steve and Bruce did an extended duet and just did not want to finish that song.<br/>\nBorn to Run rocked too - he was so into that song. Before they left the stage Bruce pointed right at me - and smiled - what a connection - just awesome. I had some other eye contact before, but that was a big thank you - I was on top of the world!!!<br/>\nCity Rocks, he transformed USA still another way, and made the full band version his again, an anti-clampdown on civil rights. What brilliance!! Land was better that the Tracks tour, and it really clicked for me last night. That song is cool. After that song, I asked for \"one more song\" and Bruce just started smiling and laughing with that awesome smile he has. What a show.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Jill Imperiale</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">The show was great. Bruce came out and appeared to be in a bad mood, but things changed as soon as he started the show. The only thing I can compare this current show to is the one I saw in Vegas a week earlier, and this one was much better. His banter was fun, commenting on the lack of luxury boxes, (last time in LA he played Staples Center which is filled with them) and that he could see the beer stands open at the back of the floor. His reference to Patti as his \"Nitro Viagra\" got a giggle from many as well as calling Roy, \"The illegitimate son of Jerry Lee Lewis and Liberace.\" Many of the new songs were much stronger than Vegas, including The Rising and Mary's Place. In my humble opinion, though I think it is an incredible song on the new CD, Counting On A Miracle really comes off flat. Also, though I think crowds might be upset, he needs to retire Thunder Road for awhile. It's the same thing, Bruce seems to be bored with it. Not the same as the reunion tour, but it is so great to see new material and it really translates well to the stage. The only complaint I have is the crowds. Could they be any worse? Maybe it's just the lame coast I live on (WEST COAST), but people sitting down for Badlands? The Forum crowd was more into it than Vegas, but at least half of the crowd in the stands was sitting for most of the show. That is really disappointing for me, since the crowd energy mixed with Bruce and the bands incredible magnetism is what turned me into a fan.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Jeff Metzger</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">OK, let s get one thing straight at the beginning. If you know of this web site, it s because you re a committed fan. And if you are a committed fan, you are doing a disservice to yourself if you do not take the time to get to the show early and ensure a place in the pit. No excuses; no compromises; no surrender. You gotta want it bad enough. It is an incredible experience to see a real live icon up that close without spending your life savings. Get the GA tickets, go early, have some fun, destroy your backs (take plenty of Advil), and you won t regret it. Here s my report from a great day at the LA Forum.<br/>\nDetermination of when to arrive: How early should we get there in order to get in first 300 for a wristband? Well, we saw Johnny s posting from Vegas in which he arrived at 11:00 and got #149. Figuring that more information would lead to more people arriving earlier, we settled on 10:00. At 10:05 we were given #s 237 and 238. (#300 was given out at 11:30). Here s some more information on the wristband/pit process.<br/>\nI had thought from reading Backstreets.com that the line-up procedure was something official organized by either the band or the arena. No so. This is an unofficial, self-policing procedure that requires the arena security staff to accept it. Apparently with one exception there has been no problems at any of the venues. It is organized by a few of the fans who have been chasing the tour around. Didn't get all of their names, but good guys, who work hard to make sure that the process runs smoothly. When arriving they put your name on the list and write your # on your left hand. You then go to the end of line where you set up shop. About every hour they come around and take roll (they tell you when each roll call will be) and if you re not there for the roll-call, you come off the list.<br/>\nThe process worked like clock-work all day. There was one small period of uncertainty as to whether they would checking names and numbers at the entrance, but that got worked out successfully such that a Forum security employee was given the list and nobody except those on the list were let in. After getting past him, our tickets were scanned and then people gave us two wristbands one for floor; one for pit. They actually give out more than 300 wristbands because people get on the list without tickets to show hoping to buy extra GAs later. Also, several people missed a roll-call and were bumped, so if you get between 300 and 350 you re likely to still get to pit.<br/>\nThe pit area is larger than needed for 300 people, so if you re not interested in crowding to front of stage, you can have a very nice few from about 15 feet away without any people around you.<br/>\nAll of the new songs were as good or better live than on the album. Better than I expected. Empty Sky a highlight. I've had trouble warming up to the musical arrangement on the album. In concert, it s acoustic just Bruce, his guitar, and Patty. Terrific, and much better than album. The Rising already has the feel live of something that is not brand new. Starting with Rising and ending with LOHAD is a real feel good theme.<br/>\nAnd thank you Bruce for including Atlantic City. A major highlight of the show. And a special thanks for not playing Two Hearts , a view shared by those around me.<br/>\nSomebody in pit called out for Silvio. Bruce looked down, said that Silvio is a fictitious character, but that the guy standing next to him was a great rock and roll guitarist.<br/>\nDancing in the Dark and Ramrod better than in past. Very high energy. World s Apart coming together live. BIUSA gotta love it, especially a by-play between Bruce and Max at the end where during Max s most strenuous part of the song, Bruce wouldn't let him move on just kept making him play the same thing over and over. The rest of the band was watching with big smiles. Max was exhausted by the end of the song. Even more significantly about this song was the way in which introduced it. He said he was going to give a couple of Public Service Announcements. The first was for the night s designated food bank. The second was to remind people that our civil liberties are under attack and that we must keep an eye out before it s too late (a terrific moment for this proud Liberal). He then said, though, that we should be proud to born in the USA and then the song started. Great!<br/>\nConcluded LOHAD with a line from People Get Ready. Wonderful. Hopefully he ll do a full verse or two of People Get Ready in future.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I was wrong, the show in Phoenix brought not only the same feeling back to me but also exceeded all my expectations. Springsteen and the E-Street Band - by the way also featuring Soozie Tyrell on violin - offered something new without loosing their classic values.<br/>\nI flew to Phoenix this time after purchasing a GA-ticket for a reasonable price. Fortunately I made it to reserve my place in a limited- to-300-people-area next to the stage. In a venue with 22.000 people I stood only two, three meters away from the band and had an awesome view. From the opening song on the tone of Bruce and his E Street Band seemed to be quite different from the reunion concerts. Here I must confess, that I love the new album, at least as much as Darkness\u2026 and by far more than Born In the USA or Tunnel\u2026 . So I really appreciate, that most new songs have become a certain part of the sets. When The Rising followed by Lonesome Day opened the show, the audience sounded pretty thrilled. I felt that both songs may become all time live classics. Whether Empty Sky , You're Missing , Waiting On A Sunny Day , Worlds Apart they all boosted our enthusiasm more and more. Even Mary's Place, which is the only one of the album, I regarded to be unnecessary, came in a amazing live version, which opened the party for the introduction of the band - as a new replacement of Rosilita or 10th Avenue Freeze out . I am not sure, but the song rocked much better than on the album. What did I miss? Maybe American Skin which had been played one night before in LA. But Dancing in The Dark - what a great new full band version - let me forget such thoughts immediately<br/>\nWe all danced and danced and couldn't stop dancing. My City of Ruins , made me on the verge of tears such an unbelievable great performance. A full band version of Born In The USA and a rocking Land of Hope And Dreams ended another unforgettable night with Bruce and the E Street Band.<br/>\nFinally I may confirm, that Springsteen concerts at least in the US are long travels worth\u2026. even when the set-list do not change a lot this tour.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Tom Cantillon</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">When I first got a preview of the tour at the convention hall in Asbury Park, I was wondering about the story Bruce was trying to tell, based upon the order of songs played. With all previous tours, Bruce would weave a story throughout the show as a result of the songs he played. At the Convention Hall shows, the story had been unclear. But that changed in Phoenix. While on vacation I snagged a ticket and went to the show and as the songs were played, the story unfolded. From \"The Rising\" through \"\"You're Missing\"\", Bruce's story was about not only surviving, but transcending and in a way, also finding a spiritual sanctification. And when he and the band blasted through \"Promised Land\", \"World's Apart\" and \"Badlands\", the story and message shouted for a coming together! Bruce and the band and the songs became church, and they did so in hope of bringing a little relief, liberation and celebration of life to all of us. We don't need to have been in NY that day to have been affected by it. We all have been. And the great thing about Bruce and the new songs is that they don't claim to have any real answers, he's just trying to keep us on our feet and \"Rising\" above those \"Badlands\". The Phoenix show proved that. Thanks, Bruce. A long time fan from Jersey.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Joyce Hinrichsen</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">The Vegas show was weak, and I blame the crowd. The Thomas and Mack Arena was only about 75% full, and half the people there seemed to be (by the look and level of enthusiasm) simply Vegas vacationers taking in a show. As a 22 year veteran of Bruce concerts (and a fan of over 25 years), I just knew he'd do \"Viva Las Vegas\", but even this wasn't enough for me to say that the show was \"good\". The band sounded over-rehearsed and disappointing to someone like me who has seen better days. This simply would not do! Instead of trying to get into the (sold-out) L.A. show, I went to Phoenix where I was able to get a General Admission ticket and a place in line good enough to get me a spot right up against the stage! I was standing 3 people to the left of center stage, right in front of Clarence. We flirted all night! Bruce high-fived me and during \"Bobby Jean\", he leaned towards me, smiled and strummed his guitar as I clapped in time with the music, making total eye contact for the entire 7 seconds (I replayed this moment in my mind so many times that I could actually clock it!) The energy level was very high, and the set list was comparable to the L.A. show with the exception of \"American Skin\" which he did not do. Although the Phoenix show was not sold out, they must have made some last minute sales because the place seemed pretty packed - and with TONS of seasoned tramps. The America West Arena was totally immersed in Bruce Juice Sunday night, and there was at least one person there that night who got to live out her dream of being right up front at a Springsteen show. I sang, I danced, I laughed, I cried, I even said a little prayer of thanks, I took the night for all it gave me and I think I proved it all night that I was having the BEST time of anyone else there. In fact, when I got back to my hotel, my husband said I was glowing! I don't know about anyone sitting in the rafters, but from someone who was right down front, the show was dynamite!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>BackstreetSister</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">This is not a review because let me tell ya, when Bruce Springsteen is singing a foot from your face dripping sweat upon you, your critical thinking skills fly right out the mother f*cking arena. I don't know where this is going to start or finish because words are not coming easy right now. I still seem to be in some kind of strange post-concert nirvana.<br/>\nBeing right up against the stage and dead center was unbelievable, literally. I couldn't believe it was happening and that I was really there. When the band came out I thought I was going to pass out. I had to remind myself to breathe, it was so tense it was like the air got heavy and was charged with electricity, and it built as each member of the band came out. There's a narrow strip at the front of the stage that's a step down from the rest of the stage. Bruce came down there for some songs and was close enough to touch. Being so close to him and the band made it feel like being a participant rather than an observer. It was so immediate and so powerful. One of the things I realized is that what makes him so good is he is fully and completely in the present, whatever the present may be whether it's Empty Sky or Ramrod, he is living what the song means, feeling what he wants us to feel. As much as he gives out he expects and gets back that much from the crowd. We're feeding off each other but instead of consuming us it grows bigger. It's so big it could knock you off your feet. At times it overwhelms. It's a symbiosis and it's transcendent. At the same time it's obvious Bruce is fully aware of where he is on the stage, how he's connected to each member of the band and the crowd. The set list was duct-taped to the floor in front of his mic stand. I had no sense of how the crowd was as a whole except by Bruce's reaction to what was happening. He seemed pleased and thanked the crowd and Phoenix for being good to the band over the years. The new songs are so much better live, but especially Empty Sky. Patti and Bruce singing together and it was heartbreakingly, exquisitely beautiful. The setlist seemed to flow perfectly and it was like riding a roller coaster, going up, building, careening down, swinging around curves, rising and falling again and finally rolling back into the station with LOHAD.<br/>\nHighlights and observations:<br/>\nBruce has his eyes closed when he's playing a guitar solo.<br/>\nI didn't think the sound would be very good where I was but it was very good.<br/>\nMary's Place worked great for me. I loved it. It was on this one that Bruce was leaning over the front row singing his ass off and dripping sweat on me, no more than a foot from my face.<br/>\nBorn to Run: Bruce held out his guitar and let us play it.<br/>\nHaving Bruce looking directly in my eyes when he sang 'Tonight I'll be on that hill cause I can't stop' during Darkness.<br/>\nRamrod was an absolute blast, they had SO much fun with it!!! When Bruce sang 'I swear I think of your pretty face when I let her unwind' he sort of crouched down in front of me and pointed straight at me and wiggled his eyebrows. OH MY GOD did that just really happen or am I dreaming??? Later he shook his ass right in my face\u2026 Oh yes I was tempted to grope LOL.<br/>\nWhen he jumped onto the piano he seemed to struggle a bit. I think performing the way he he does is physically painful for him. He looks VERY trim though. I think he's at the perfect weight right now and I think part of the reason for that is so all that jumping around and pogoing doesn't hurt so much. His boots have rubber soles (!)<br/>\nClarence. The Big Man has such a great presence. After the first encore when the band was taking their bows he teared up he just looked so happy and grateful.<br/>\nBruce is so compelling on stage it's hard to take your eyes off him. I was watching the others at times but not for long. The man is riveting. I do think there's a unique dynamic between Bruce and the band some combination of those people that makes magic. But Bruce is the catalyst for it all.<br/>\nI never thought I'd be saying this because I was dreading it so much but the GA line was actually fun. Trading stories and getting to know other Tramps made the time fly. I got there at 9:00 in the morning and was #24 on the list. The weather forecasters had predicted a record-tying 112 degree high for Sunday and I think that kept a lot of GA ticket holders away 'til the end of the day. I think by 2 or 3:00 there were only a hundred people on the list. The line is being run by volunteers who do it out of the goodness of their hearts and because it gets them the choice positions at the shows. Once you sign up and have your hand numbered you can leave 'til the next roll call which at the beginning was every three hours, then every two hours. At 4:00 it changed to hourly. The venue gave out the wrist bands prior to the doors opening. When the doors opened at 6:00 most people respected the positions they'd had in line as we headed to the stage but a few raced forward. As soon as the guys behind me ran past me I started running too. The security guards were screaming at us to 'WALK!' but I was going as fast as I needed to keep anybody else from passing me. I ended up to the right of Patti in front of the piano initially. I was there 'til about 7:00 when I was upgraded to center stage. I think I said 'Oh my God' several thousand times LOL.<br/>\nI'm going to shut up now because I sound like I'm at the freakin' Oscars and it was a whole lot better than that. It's an experience I'll treasure for the rest of my life, it's seared into my mind, my heart and my soul forever.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Brooks</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Well I had GA tickets and I was bringing my college buddy Dave (his first Bruce concert) so I wanted to get as close as possible. So I packed up the cooler, got the lawn chairs and magazines out and got to Compaq at 10:00. I was stoked because we were 77th in line guaranteeing us a spot in the pit. I had no idea what the line would be like but it was awesome. So many hard core Springsteen fans exchanging Springsteen stories and just enjoying the wait. There were three guys in line who had their guitars and were playing some classic Springsteen songs and quite well I must add. Another highlight of the line was a man (who I talked to later inside) ordered pizza for the first 100 people line. It was such a nice thing to do especially being a starving college student. It was great to be in line with all these nice people because everyone was watching out for each other, if anyone tried to cut there were 10 people on their case. I also must complement the lady in yellow who did a great job maintaining order in the GA line. Later on in the day the news came by and interviewed the lady right in front of us (Delores was her name I think) she was really nice and obviously a huge fan, anyways she got a cameo on the news hopefully it didn't get on the cutting room floor. Ok on to the show \u2026<br/>\nThey let us in at about 6:15 , Dave and I (Chad) were about four or five rows back from the stage. I met some great people including Joe who was stoked to see that 20 year old still loved Springsteen's music. I also talked to the guy who ordered all the pizzas and I learned he hasn't missed a tour since 73. He also mentioned some classic performances at the Bottom Line and Stone Pony . . I am so jealous. The excitement was mounting since the last time I saw the band I was up in the nose bleeds. Well Bruce and the band came on at about 8:30 and played to 11:00. This was by far the best concert I have ever been to. The pit was constantly getting lit up like we were part of the show. Everyone was pumping their fists and raising their hands as we sang along word for word to every song.<br/>\nHighlights of the night had to be well it was all a highlight but to pick out spots during Waiting on a Sunny Day as we sang along at the end the \"do do do do do do do do do\" Bruce was looking out at the pit pointing to fans and smiling. Well all of a sudden his finger is pointed right at us as he smiles. We went crazy, the man himself recognizing us. As the show went on I couldn't help but wonder if it was really us he was pointing at. Then during Mary's Place (a song that was made for a live audience) he made eye contact again - I couldn't believe it. After Land Of Hope and Dreams the band all came up and took a bow and once again Bruce was saying something (I couldn't quite read his lips) to different people in the pit. All of sudden he pointed right at us for a third time and all I could do was say THANK YOU over and over again, hopefully he could read my lips.<br/>\nNeedless to say my friend is now sold on Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. Bruce was doing a full cardio workout, sweating the pounds away and sponging himself down between songs. The band was also flawless and I am just praying there is second leg to this tour like the reunion tour. I called my brother after the show (who is also a huge fan) and he couldn't believe my story. He said \"Dude, you will never forget this\" That is for sure. It seemed like all day that we waited then I blinked and the show was over (I guess because I was having so much fun). After the show my friend and I were talking about him pointing at us and concluded it had to be us since we were the youngest people in the pit. It must be a thrill for Bruce to see that his music is still incredibly popular to fans who weren't even born when Born to Run came out. To close this review all I can say is get out and see this show and if you have the chance get floor tickets and when you do get there early, no matter how long you have to wait it is worth it.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Marianne</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Jessica Springsteen's singing debut has not been commented on yet. During the audience participation part of Waitin' on a Sunny Day, Bruce went to the side of the stage (Patti side) where his 2 younger kids and their cousins/friends were sitting with their elbows on the stage. He put the mike in front of Jessica and she belted out Waitin' on a Sunny Day\u2026 Bruce was literally \"bowled over\" \u2014 he fell down, rolled over etc. in mock astonishment. This was the highlight of the show for me. Looks like Jessica is the next rock star in the family.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Clearly tired (from the MTV VMA?) Bruce gave it his all, and started what appears to have been the beginning of his setlist changes with the addition of Downbound Train in place of Darkness. Classic moment when some instrument (piano?) let out an unmusical noise during \"Thunder Road\" - Bruce appeared both irritated and amused, and made some comments about that being \"one hell of a radio\". He was laughing throughout most of the rest of the song, and it's amazing that he finished.<br/>\nOddly large number of empty seats for a city that has had no trouble filling seats for a Springsteen show. Must have been a combination of $75 tickets, Labor Day Weekend, and relatively short period between sale date and showtime. Still, VERY enthusiastic crowd that sang along with even some of the Rising material. Regardless of mistaken popular belief, Bruce has a devoted following outside of NJ and the East Coast. Probably a stretch to hope for a 2003 show, but Bruce did promise that he'd be back \"next summer\". Don't make promises you can't keep, Boss\u2026</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

It was a great moment that you file away in your \"memory palace\" and then assume is gone. Well, about 2 months ago, I received a email offering me tickets to the show (I couldn't believe he remembered, but that's what makes these guys great).<br/>\nAnyway, here's a secret about the Pepsi Center. If you eat at the restaurant before the show and need to use the bathroom, you will find out that you can end up about 50 feet behind the stage and listen to the soundcheck! (Killer versions of Ties and Stand On It)!<br/>\nWhen I get to \"will call\", it turns out that not only are the seats 15 feet from the stage, 4 rows up!, they come with backstage passes! We chatted with Nils for a bit before the show, which was a real thrill.<br/>\nAs for the show itself, it blew me away.<br/>\nThe Rising and Lonesome Day blew the roof off right from the beginning. The song selection was amazing, with some great rarities worked in- Ties, Candy's Room, Racing in the Street, and I'm a Rocker in the encores. But the heart and soul of this show are the songs from The Rising. Everyone in the crowd new the words and sometimes were so loud it was hard to hear Bruce!<br/>\nThe show stopper was the sequence of Empty sky. Your Missing (with an incredible solo by Danny) and then Waiting On a Sunny Day. Absolutely stunning to go from total sorrow to total elation in 10 minutes, but that's Bruce.<br/>\nAs for the encores, the more rocky version of Dancing beats the 1984 rendition. Bruce is finally getting to have fun with it, as opposed to playing it because it's a hit. He was bouncing all over the stage! Then he talked briefly about needing to pay attention to what's happening with our civil rights, the upcoming war with Iraq and how these things relate to being Born In The USA.<br/>\nThe show ended with another classic, revved up Ramrod, and LOHD. By then, the crowd was bouncing off the rafters!<br/>\nReally, I can't say enough about the show or the truly special way I was treated.

But how much old stuff would we get? How much could he work in and still keep the show true to the new album? Well, I can only say he did a great job. He took us through sorrow, hope and promise. After opening with the Rising and Lonesome Day he brought everyone back together with the Ties that Bind. Then the Fuse followed by a very emotional rendition of Candy's Room. Next came the heartbreaking tunes of Empty Sky and Missing, but then we were brought back up with Waiting for a Sunny Day and Promised Land. A real surprise for me was hearing Worlds Apart, a great song but one that I thought might be left out because of production issues with the chants. From there we were brought to our feet several times, and at other times we had to reflect. For me the biggest moment of the night was Mary's Place, where Bruce seemed truly emotional when he sang of a friend lost.<br/>\nThe Band was tight and the violin a welcome addition. Big Man as always is the heart of this Band with Bruce being the soul.<br/>\nOnly problem I had with the show was some early sound quality problems that seemed to disappear after the second song as the techies did their job.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Nancy</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Best concert experience of my life.

Bruce was There, right there, he looked at all in the pit and knew what we had been thru to get in and up close. The whole thing came together right before my birthday and the crowd had birthday signs for Bruce. We fed off his energy and he fed off ours. Awesome, once in a lifetime.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

A combination of things went into making it one of the most glorious concert going days of my life.<br/>\nI'm from Kansas City so unlike many shows I've seen in the last couple of years I had only a 10 minutes drive down to Kemper Arena from my house. I went to the show with my brother (has seen the boss live) and my lovely new wife (has never seen the boss live). It was a little chilly in the morning as we lined up shortly before 7 a.m. Ryan was 40, Margaret was 41, and I was 42 in line. About what I thought it would be. (For those who just have to know, the line started Monday at 11:00 a.m. off the property. I think.)<br/>\nThe day had it's first thumbs up with the weather. Other than a cool morning the day was mostly glorious clear skies and 70-75 degree weather. Beautiful. The second thumbs up came with the line management. Everyone was polite, everyone helped police the line, and a few select folks took the names and number of all the fans that showed up. We did a roll call at 7:00 a.m., 8:00, 10:00, 12:00, 2:00, 4:00, and 5:00. I passed the day away drawing a picture of Bruce from a few years back. I'd like to say hi and thanks to Joel, Heidi, Tom, etc. It was fun meeting you all. That's one of the great things about GA, the fans you meet. Not everyone hung out at the line all day, many wandered around between checks, but I decided to stay put for the most part. I took my last vacation day for the show and wanted it to be a slow relaxing day in line. I did take a break with my brother to go get a sandwich at the B.O.S.S. deli. across the street. (It really is called that. It's actually just a coincidence.) We sat up some speakers at eight and played Bruce tunes until it came time to pack it in and get in a \"serious line.\"<br/>\nHere's where the venue did an atypical thing. They used the fan list for wristbanding at 5:00. I know it's happened before, but not at any show I've been to. If you weren't on the fan list, they didn't give you a wristband. Considering how well organized the list was, I thought this was a great idea. Yeah, some people complain about \"line nazi\" or whatever, but I wouldn't change the way it was handled. They let us into the arena single file and three staffers were scanning the stubs for entry. This is the part were I always get nervous. In Denver at the U2 show they had a hard time getting my bar code scanned, and I lost a lot of time there. This time all was smooth. Margaret and Ryan got in no problem too. We \"walked\" as fast as we could down to the floor and I made it to the pit first. I secured three spots in front of Patti's mike against the stage. Ryan and Margaret were there ten seconds later and we sat down to hold the spots. I loved the fact there was no barrier. Not even two feet. Just you and the stage, with some security guys in the pit with you. This was a great idea, and I'm glad they did it. Now all we had to do was wait for the light and sound checks and we would be off.<br/>\nWe got a nice surprise while we were waiting. Bruce's guitar was working on some stuff (and I swear the guy looked just like Dallas Schoo, Edge's tech, and he even played a couple of lines from With or Without you while he was testing equipment) and he walks over to my wife and hands her a Little Stevie pick. What a cool guy. Great way to pass the time. After numerous checks and rechecks and waiting the crew was off and the lights went down\u2026<br/>\nJust like the last tour, everyone comes up one at a time from center stage, each player getting a bigger roar of adulation than the rest. Of course when the BOSS gets out it's a frenzy, and he looked 50 times better than the reunion tour. Tan, thin and muscular, ready to roll with a huge grin on his face! The Rising is a great way to start a show. It's got a theatrical build to it that works really well. From the get go the sound (from my side) was loud, clear, and beautiful with just a bit of echo on the end. The pit was rockin' and rollin' and thankfully never let up until the end. We sang, we danced, we yelled 'till there was no breath in our lungs! After a spirited Rising came Lonesome Day, which also translated well live. Most of the new songs sounded harder and meaner live, and I personally loved it. Then the first of the big surprises rolled in.<br/>\nNight! I couldn't have guessed this in a million years. I sat there not even realizing what I was hearing for the first twenty seconds. Good job by all, I don't think anyone missed a beat on it. I should have guessed we'd get surprises often tonight, as the band could be heard sound checking inside in the afternoon for what seemed like forever. Thank you Bruce! After that came the expected Fuse. You know what? Screw everybody who hates this song, I like it. Not the greatest ever, but it was fun and they did the album version total justice. That of course set us up for what I thought would be Darkness on the Edge of Town or Atlantic City. Instead they do another tour premiere. Oh yeah, this night was good! We got Something in the Night, and it also sounded great!<br/>\nWe need a little quiet: The Combo of Empty Sky and You're Missing were so sweet. My wife was crying, not because of the lyrics, but because of the way they did it. Bruce and Patti's intro was mixed very well, and sounded pretty jaw dropping from my location.<br/>\nWaitin' on a Sunny Day provided the first lights up explosion of the evening. It was also Bruce's first foray over to our side. Man that guy looked like he was having a ball! Sweating and yelling and smiling like a fool! He stopped right in front of us a couple of time's and we managed a few high fives during his working of the crowd. I think it's pretty overstated fact that the crowds are loving the sing-a-long on this one. But it's true. They do.<br/>\nPromised Land was standard, but standard with Bruce means wow-cool-great. World's Apart however, just couldn't get it quite right live. I don't know, I think they've done what they can to bring this to a live setting, but it could probably go away. Bruce's insane solo at the end makes it maybe keeper\u2026but any insane Bruce solo could make a song a keeper.<br/>\nI know it's been played plenty, but Badlands was a blast for me. I just love singing to this one, and the crowd always makes it a frenzied trip. It surprises they can play the oldies with such gusto! I guess that's what makes them who they are, I just can't believe they can pull it off.<br/>\nSpeaking of pulling things off\u2026yet another tour newbie came next. Good grief what's in the KC water? She's the One was extremely cool. No other word for this song in my opinion. Not a rocker, not a slow song, just flat out cool. I for one am very glad they pulled this one out. Love that piano\u2026<br/>\nLet it rain baby! Mary's Place was exactly what everyone said it would be, including the BOSS: a HOUSE PARTY! I'm so glad some of the new songs get the crowd excited like the old ones. It sucks to see an act and no one cares until one of the oldies pop up. Not on this night with this guy. I should also say that Bruce seems to have at least as much fun teasing his band as he does teasing the audience. Great reactions all night long. It's been said by some that this is as calculated as Max's precision drumming. I don't care if it is not, the guy obviously believes in his work. I will say I was grateful for some streamlined band introductions. Counting on a Miracle didn't let the mood down as much as some have said it does. Yeah it's not Mary's Place but does it need to be? Maybe if I heard Jungle Land behind it I would disagree. Well, Jungleland behind anything is actually a pretty good idea.<br/>\nINCIDENT ON 57TH STREET!!! At first I was puzzled by what he was doing going over at Roy's piano, but I switched from some crazy idea about him playing racing in the streets solo quickly enough. Yes, it was Bruce solo, and a great one at that. The crowd behaved pretty well, not perfect, but good on the quiet ones tonight. Tour newcomer # 4! The set was rounded out with Into the Fire, which worked better than I thought it would. The band tore into the middle section harder than I figured they would. Nice way to set up the encores.<br/>\nYou know, the crowd tried to get a happy birthday thing going like 5 times tonight. Including here. It never did work. Why? Bruce ignored it, just like he did in Denver. Give it up people, if he wanted to hear it he would. I guess it's the thought that counts. :)<br/>\nI really like this new version of Dancing in the Dark, which kicked off the encores. It sounds so much more like Bruce than the album version does. It's still fun, still catchy, but feels better. He seems to like it too and sometimes a little renovating is good for a song. Ramrod followed Dancing in the Dark, and I swear the crowd was more into it than Dancing in the Dark. Sometimes I think a crowd will only fall head over heals for the top 10 hits. Glad I was wrong. Born to Run continued the intensity climb, and after a fist pumping crowd screamed that one out, the band did some bows and scurried off the stage again.<br/>\nThe second set of encores began with My City of Ruins. This has a great uplifting feel to it live. The vocals from everybody seemed to surge upwards with the song in a way the album does not. I liked it more than expected, and another top notch rendition of a new song. After a brief mentioning of the local food bank and being careful about what our government is doing to civil liberties and foreign policy, (this guy should tour with Bono) they jumped into Born in the USA. This was great, as the energy that had been building from the get go was kicked up yet another notch. Everyone is right, this version is a little crueler than previous ones. Land of Hope of Dreams kicked off and I was happy and sad to hear it. After all, it ends every show. I never used to be a big fan of it, but in recent months I've really got into Bruce's guitar part. Simple, (outside of the solo stuff he puts in) but really catchy. Loved it, including the little People Get Ready bit. After big crashes and tons of cheering the song was done. They did their bows and I expected them to be off, of they lingered. Bruce was laughing and finally said something very close to \"It's supposed to over!\" while shrugging his shoulders amid the cheers. After he said that, the crowd went off like a freaking power keg, as we all knew what that meant. A possible seventh encore? Oh yeah!<br/>\nNow I should start this by saying I've hear Kansas City played many times. Lots of artists cover it here. It makes sense to. But nothing like this. First off, I don't know if they planned on playing it for sure. The setlists taped to the stage had it in parenthesis with a trailing\u2026 after it. Kinda the maybe song. But after Bruce made that comment and everything went nuts they had to. It was a little rough, and the sound and lighting crew had no idea what Bruce would do next, but that just added to the frenzy. After pulling three or four \"MIGHT TAKE A TRAIN\" \"MIGHT TAKE A PLANE\" and BYE BYE BYE's with the audience they slowly one by one left the stage. But Roy was still there, pounding away at a solo for almost three minutes by himself!!! Finally the band, who rounded up Mr. Jon Landau and got him a guitar, came back up for another four rounds of verses!!! Oh, that was so fun! Something like 10 -15 minutes of total confusion and fun! That ended it, and after the bows, the band was gone.<br/>\nI haven't seen many Springsteen shows, but the guy to my right summed up my suspicions right away: \"I've seen Springsteen 45 times and THAT was the best!\" Five tour new comers, including one that hasn't been played in full since the early 80's, made for one heck of a night. Thank you everyone!!!<br/>\nOh, and my wife just LOVED her first show\u2026</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

The sound was not the best during the first song \"The Rising\" but once the sound was worked out the sound was GREAT! This was my first time seeing Bruce in person so this is coming from a first timer but long timer lover of Bruce's music. Hearing songs like Badlands, Promise Land, Born to Run, and for me the great song Land of Hopes and Dreams was something that I will remember forever. Opening with the title track of the Rising Bruce was in control of the crowd all night and had us on our feet all night long. For My Hometown Bruce had the lead singer of Peal Jam out with him being a hometown boy. The one and only let down for me (and it is a small let down with how great the show was) was Bruce did not do Thunder Road. But that was totally off set by him doing Born to Run. I would rate the Chicago Show as a total hot and an A+++ for me.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Ken</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Bruce put on a predictable show in Chicago. Much of the new stuff failed to take on new life, tragically. In the past, he's had the ability to transform and intensify his new material in a live setting. Here, it only demonstrated that his songwriting edge has diminished considerably and the generic qualities in the songs seemed to limit their power. I'm a die-hard, so I hate to say that. The new stuff (11 of 23 songs) sounded very basic. \"Countin' on a Miracle\" (aka \"Countin' On an Open Stall\") should be deep-sixed from the set (his worst song since \"The Long Goodbye\"). The entire crowd was sitting on their hands during the song. \"Mary's Place\" seemed like forced fun. \"For You\" at the piano was the show's highlight \u2014 stunning. As was the \"Badlands\" \"She's the One\" duo. The Vedder \"My Hometown\" was better than it could have been, with Eddie doing a serviceable job without much spark. The sound in the not-so-cheap seats was a large problem as well. There has got to be a way to make the big houses sound better. I don't know if I'm alone on this one, but \"Land of Hope and Dreams\" should've been retired as the closer for this tour. Another song that worked last time, but sounded boring this tour. Many, knowing it was the last song, bolted early. Of the new stuff, \"My City of Ruins\" was beautifully done. So was \"Into the Fire.\" However, not including \"Paradise\" is unforgiveable. On the whole, BS was in good spirits and often playful, but overall the show seemed sapped of the traditional Bruce power.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>WindyCityShippy</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">We were in Section 331, which is WAY up there, but had a clear shot at the stage without video assistance. Bruce came out looking circa 1978, which for me, was great to see. The Rising and Lonesome Day really cooked, and the crowd was into from the first note. Bruce seemed especially energized as usual, and it seems that he and Max are raring to go. Ties That Bind and Jackson Cage worked for me, because that was my personal indoctrination into the E Street Nation when I was a senior in high school during the River tour. The new songs went over very well, both in terms of performance by the band, and acceptance by our crowd. Both Worlds Apart and The Fuse which sound very complex on the album came off very well live, and really rocked with a ferocious trade off of leads by Bruce, Nils, and Steve, who spent considerable time playing an old Gibson Firebird I believe. Waiting on A Sunny Day has a very warm feel to it, and might be a better song to introduce the band, because I felt that Mary's Place was the only real clunker last night. Bruce did a great job of supporting/promoting the new material, but at the same time, incorporating a lot relevant songs from the old material. Witnessing Bruce perform For You on Roy's piano was stunning. That song is at least or over 30 years old now, and to see Bruce all alone at the ivory really gave me a sense of how this may have all started for him. Equally, having Eddie Vedder come out for a little duet on My Hometown was a nice touch too. Eddie did himself proud, and was naturally well received. The encores were fairly typical, based on the postings from previous shows, but I will say that I thought I could detect a certain bitter cynicism in Bruce's voice as he sang BIUSA this time. We all know and understand that this song is NOT the wrap yourself in the flag, chest beating anthem Reagan and others thought it represented, but Bruce's delivery last night sounded even more biting than I can recall. As always, good to see the Band, and would agree with an earlier posting that as the train rolls on, even better performances will arise.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Dan Foley</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">My wife and I really enjoyed the show. The show picked up dramatically after 'World's Apart' and was a thrill to watch all the way to the end. Some of the highlights were 'For You' and 'Jackson Cage' along with (believe it or not) \"Dancing the the Dark\". Eddie Vedder could have at least learned the words to 'My Hometown'. I think; I suspect, that when Bruce sits at the piano to play, he needs reading glasses. It looked like he was struggling to read the lyrics and play (even with the knuckleheads screaming during a quiet song). It was a treaty to hear it though\u2026.. It is worth mentioning that for those 20 somethings, who like the hard crap on MTV - these guys are still creative - and are still the real deal.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>NothingMan</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Wow. What a show. A few tour debuts, chestnuts and a surprise guest.<br/>\nI'm sure most of you have seen this setlist by now, so I won't bother to recap. Suffice to say that Jackson Cage was a HUGE surprise (and one that I think most did not recognize). And then to follow it up two songs later w/ \"The Ties that Bind\" was great. She's the One rocked, probably the best version of it I have seen. For you was another big surprise and sounded great solo on the piano. Overall, the band sounded great, better than the Cleveland show I at. The set seems to flow better and have fewer down points. Worlds Apart and Counting still drag the momentum down, but what the hell. If this had been my first show for the tour, I would have been more into them. The show also feels a bit lighter than the earlier stops. The new songs are adding some variety and the show seems to be getting more of a rock and roll feel than a \"message\" show. Eddie Vedder coming out blew everyone away. He seemed to struggle a bit with the lyrics at times and Bruce had to bail him out on the third verse. But when he found the right rhythm, he sounded great. It looked like at some point, Bruce cut his pinky on his left hand. During one solo (I think it was Worlds, but I can't swear to it), you could clearly see red on his finger and a few spots on the fret board. But it never seemed to bother him and it certainly didn't slow him down!!! It seems to me that the tour is building steam and they are much more comfortable playing the new stuff. \"The Rising\" is getting better (I've always thought it has sounded rough) and Lonesome Day comes across great, a bit more of a rocker live.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Scott Zoldan</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">I was in the pit with my arms on the stage and during your missing, clarence was crying harder than I have ever seen someone cry, bruce cut his finger on his guitar and it was bleeding thereafter, clarence motioned for the guy behind me to come onstage several times but he did not wish too, maybe he was a relative or someone famous. this was my 3rd show on this tour and miles ahead of the rest and i was in the pit for the other 2 also. bruce steve and big man looke liked they were having more fun than normal.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>The Rapper</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">What a night! I had just seen Bruce in KC two nights earlier and was doing my own little tour tied to some business commitments. Speaking of business, Bruce was ALL business. As he was in the middle of The Rising tour, there was a lot of emotion in the evening. As usual, it was a rollercoaster ride up and down the emotional scale as we laughed, cried, hugged and danced to the best music known to man. You know, when you go to a show by the E Street Band, you should always be with a great friend or a great love. I was fortunate to be able to share the emotion of the evening with someone special and it just exponentially heightened all of that wonderful emotion. Hearing \"The Fuse\" live with a red light on Bruce and some gentle percussion from Max and Clarence was incredible. \"The Fuse IS burning\". Great rockers like \"Ramrod\", \"She's The One\", \"Badlands\", \"BTR\" - tremendous. The venue was a little too big for the intimacy that such a show commands, but, hey, when it's The Boss - and a special friend - it's heaven on earth. Forever friends.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Bruce and the Band seemed to bring a little extra energy and the crowd responded beautifully (unlike the '99 tour). Saw this tour in St. Louis and Chicago but this was the best yet. Little Queenie at the end was pure and raucous fun and frivolity, reminiscent of the Detroit medley of past tours. My, my, my\u2026 as Bruce would say\u2026 next to cold beer at a reasonable price, this was as good as it gets! Thanks Boss.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Rob Zapelli</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">My god what a show. The band came out to play tonight and they rocked the house in a big way. The lights went out and the crowd went nuts.<br/>\nDuring the first two songs Bruce was having a bit of trouble with his jacket flapping over the end of his guitar which was interfering with his playing and he looked a little pissed and most of the guitar work was being handles by Steve and Nils who looked to be a lot more into the show then before. After the one two punch of the Rising and Lonesome Day Max powered into No Retreat from Born in the USA and set the Bradley Center on fire and about blew the roof of the whole place. The fuse followed this in was a simmering, smoldering version, especially when Bruce pulls away the instruments, the red glare of the spotlight hits his face as he sings \"You're bittersweet taste on my tongue.\"<br/>\nBruce starts moaning and it's a visit way back to '78 for 'Something in the Night' it appears like a lot of the crowd aren't that familiar with the song but man does he punch it out. I really dug this one a lot. The show slows down here for Empty Sky and You're Missing and the crowd gets swept up in the emotion. Clarence cries like he did in Chicago and the emotion is palpable. The fans on the floor are still swaying, but many of the audience in the seats have sat down so Bruce tells them it's time to get sexy as he goes into a rousing rendition of Waiting on a Sunny day. He really works the crowd and cuts the music to let the crowd sing along. He presses the mic into the audience and a eight or nine year old girl gets to sing to which Bruce responds \"hey that was really good\". He does the obligatory slide across the stage and the crowd goes wild again. Next we swing into another crowd pleaser with the promised land and the band just smokes. The sound for this show was really clear and you could hear each crash of the cymbals and each note from the piano and guitars, I was a lot more impressed with the sound for this show than for anything else I'd heard thus far. The mood then slows down again for World apart and though a lot of the audience used this song for their toilet break it sounds very akin to the album version, even without Asif Ali Khan and his 'qawwli' band. The audience kind of let this song down a bit by their general apathy but the show picked up steam again immediately when the band explodes into Badlands and everyone rushes back into their seats from the lobby. This got one of the biggest reactions of the night and absolutely blasted through the sound system.<br/>\nShe's the one followed and the crowd still jams away enthusiastically and though the song is nearing 30 years it sounds fresh and vibrant.<br/>\nBruce asks the crowd \"are you loose\" a reference to the famous Milwaukee bomb scare show and then takes us for a house party with Mary's place. Tonight the song gets a new chorus and new lyrics during a verse which works really well, to compensate for this he runs through the band intro's pretty quickly except for Clarence Clemons for whom Bruce says \"You all wanna be like him, but you just can't, he goes on to call him either the most talented or intelligent lifeform in the universe. Whatever it was he said the crowd ate it up.<br/>\nAfter this is another rising song and then come the point in the show where Bruce has been pulling a surprise number. I was thinking maybe Cadillac Ranch for the line about the Wisconsin Night seeing as we're in Milwaukee but instead he pulls out an acoustic version of Mary Queen of Arkansas. What the hell? He never plays this anymore, ever. It was voted as his worst song ever in his own fanzine. Though I gotta admit I was surprised as hell to hear him play it, I actually liked it. The acoustic working sounded really good and it was worth it to see the front ten rows standing their with their mouths hung open by the fact he was playing it.<br/>\nBruce starts solo on Into the Fire and one by one the band join in and it's like a communal gathering. This song was really moving and the crowd really paid a lot of attention. The band walk of stage but are back in no time at all for an awesome version of Dancing in the Dark. This song really rocked with the four guitars and I tell you take away the synthesizer and the disco back beat and you've got a hell of a song. Much, much better than the studio version. This ought to be a b-side for one of the Rising's songs upcoming single. Bruce follows up with a thundering Ramrod during which he really lights up the guitar. Towards the end he says I think it's quitting time, the crowd yells \"Nooooo\" Bruce says it's time to go home, crowd \"noooo\" Bruce says \"It's bedtime\" crowd \"Nooooo\" Bruce \"I got my pajama's on underneath my clothes\" Crowd \"nooo\" Bruce \"Ok Steve, what time is it\" Steve \"It's Boss time\" Crowd goes wild for the umpteenth time as Bruce and Steve do the six string duel before the band does a conga line up the ramp towards the people with seats behind the stage.<br/>\nThen the biggest crowd reaction of the night and the song I always anticipate the most as those first few chords for Born to Run hits. The house lights go up and close to 20,000 people are going nuts, dancing from the rafters in an absolute frenzy. The band walks off again and everyone stays on their feat begging for them to come back.<br/>\nWhile the band stays in the back Bruce comes out and sits on the piano and begins to play my city of ruin as the band files out to join him.<br/>\nThis song is like church here, everyone is swaying and it's prayer time. It was just amazing. Bruce leaves the piano, raises his hands to the heavens and sings the refrain and then as the band plays the music he does a little dance and you can just tell that he is having the time of his life out there. Around this time in Chicago his voice was starting to give out but he was hitting all the note this time around, though when he gave his speech after this song about being vigilant in regards to our civil rights in this time of possible war it began to crack a bit, but soon as he started belting out Born in the USA it seemed to have righted himself and he spat out his rock god anthem like it was nobody's business. Bruce really doesn't get enough credit for his ability on the guitar because he attacked the solo to this one with the same kind of ferocity as a Hendrix or a Page. I'm surprised the strings didn't catch fire, I really am.<br/>\nThen came Land of hope and Dreams and though it's a terrific song I was starting to feel a bit maudlin as I knew it was the last song for the evening. I mean after all every other show of the tour except Kansas has ended after this right? As he sang the People get ready refrain there's a train a coming, don't need no ticket, just get on board I was almost pouting. The band said their goodbyes, Nil's gave his guitar away to the roadie and the band turned ready to file off, but the crowd was pleading \"One more, one more\"<br/>\nBruce shook his head, slung the guitar over his shoulder and tuned back to the mike, the band looking around bewildered, they had no idea what he was doing, it was totally of the cuff. It sent the crowd into raptures though. \"We got one more\" Bruce shouts, \"just for Milwaukee.\" The band still didn't know what song was coming and Bruce told them it's in 'C\" I'll cue you in. I thought for sure this time we'd be going to Cadillac Ranch but nope, it was \"Jailbait time\" as Bruce fires up a classic Chuck Berry riff and the band fires into a rocking, rockabilly version of Little Queenie. The band follows Bruce offstage leaving Danny, Roy and Max behind still tearing up the stage with a terrific jam, before the rest off the band sneaks back up from the stage with Bruce carrying a rubber chicken under his arm. The song ends the band files off and everyone starts filing out, except those few who stay behind to hear Bruce playing on the video screen with his hair slicked back and his acoustic guitar singing in falsetto. I'm not sure what the song was but it was defiantly not his usual voice, sounded good though.<br/>\nI'm totally spent, the show was terrific again, as always. There's been a lot of talk of the show being too expensive and whatever at $75 bucks but the couple sitting behind me came down from Florida and spent $400 bucks apiece for their tickets. the guy was having his 50th birthday and had never seen a Bruce show before, he thought it was worth every cent.<br/>\nI was hoping this show would be enough to convert my wife into a Springsteen fan and although she said she enjoyed the show I don't think she's there quite yet. I think she got more entertainment over my crazy antics and reactions than she did from the show itself, but there's more shows and she'll get there eventually. She did let me listen to Bruce in the car all the way home which is pretty rare.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I ended in the 14th row with my GA ticket. This was my 9th Bruce show. What simply amazes me is that he and the band just kept better \u2014 year after year after year. The Rising kicked off the. It's a great way to star. The band hit it like a ton of bricks. Lonesome Day followed. Then we heard No Surrender \u2014 a surprise for me with the full band version. I help my breath during Empty Sky and You're Missing. Bruce and Patti's harmony vocals took the two songs to a different level. My eyes became slightly teary-eyed. Further is another song that works great live. This is my show of the Rising tour. I still haven't heard The Fuse \u2014 a song that moves me tremendously. It's a song about how important physical intimacy is in times of great upheavel. The songs from the Rising worked live. The highlights also included Nothing Man, which was done very similarly to Empty Sky. Then I heard Roy's piano. Could it be? Racing in the Street. This has one of favorite songs since I've been a Bruce fan of 20 years. I closed my eyes and let the song take me to another place. Bruce also did the full band version of Born in the USA. I've felt mixed feelings about this song live. it's essentially a song about the unhappy aftermath of war. Last light Bruce prefaced it with remarks about the need for due process and how our other civil rights have taken with beating under President Bush. He also warned about getting involved with Iraq without more details \u2014 which it true. Then he played the song. The entire arena erupted. I always like the slide guitar version. My only complaint was that even as close as we were standing, some of the audience watched Bruce in the video monitors. Aside from this, this is a powerful, moving and transcending concert. That you Bruce and the E Streeters. This was a goddammed event.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>LoverInTheCold</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Dear lord. You could not possibly get any better than this. The day, the wait, getting in the front row of the pit, TOUCHING BRUCE!!!! The Boss looked his best ever last night, coming out, unshaven in a pin stripe suit coat and hushing the crowd with his presence. And the crowd went absolutely wild when Further On, came on, it was a mid-age mosh pit, and it surprised me to see people three times my age responding like they were school kids. Bruce was absolutely \"on fire\", he could sense the fact that this crowd was HERE and they were INTO it. We jumped, bumped, and pumped until we needed oxygen masks. Bruce became really aware of the crowd during \"Promised Land\", coming down and reaching out to the audience, blowing his harmonica in the ears of a 'security guard' who looked like he didn't want to be there. But the highlight of this most-amazing show was a beautiful version of \"Racing in the Street\" which just might be better that the 79' version that is highly regarded as the best. Waiting on a Sunny Day was acoustic and it sounded better that way. I almost launched myself on stage during the rendition of \"Dancing in the Dark\". Stevie threw me his pick, but the asshole camera man bumped me out of the way and some little girl, who looked unhappy to be there, got it. I'm happy for her though and hope she cherishes it forever. BTR was smashing and he originally planned to only do three songs in the final encore but he did 4!, with his reworked working on the highway, still rousing the very tired crowd for one last hurrah. This was the most amazing time of my life, I've been alive for 18 years but hadn't really lived until last night. I really hope somebody can do a boot, because it probably was the hottest and tightest show of the tour. It was just that tight, not a flaw. I want more!!!!!!! I must have it. Luckily it looks like they were taping it from many angles, the cameraman told me they were going to make it into a DVD 'special' like LIVE in Madison Square Garden, so hopefully next year we'll have a Springsteen: Live from St. Paul disc.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I feel very lucky to have been a part of that experience. As you all know it was amazing. I first saw Bruce 9/25/78, and ever since then I have been hooked. However, the show in Boston really had a lasting effect. I can not get enough to read, see, or hear enough about \"The Boss\". I have visited your site and the Springsteen.net site everyday since the concert last week trying to find out a little bit more each day about the man and his music. The man is a poet and a genius. If everyone could have that much passion for what they do, the world would be a better place. Also, what comes with the passion is hope. No matter what the meaning of one of his songs, there is always hope in each one (show a little faith There's magic in the night..).\"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Joe Wheeler</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">WOW!!! What a show. Bruce always does something special in Boston and last night was no exception. The special moments of the night were \"Candy's Room\" and the piano solo of \"For You\". The surprise was \"Dirty Water\". It was how they did it. Peter Wolf was his usual self, all over the stage but at the end of the song the band walked off stage, single file, still playing. Except Max. The lights were down and the stage was dark and Max kept banging away. The crowd was into it big time. The Lights came up and the full band was on stage and let it rip. This was my 29th concert and probably the best closer I've ever seen. The best news of the night was when Bruce said, \"We'll be back, see you soon.\" Can't wait for 2003.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Ted Tyson</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">What a show Bruce put on tonight. Fantastic choices in the setlist, including No Surrender, Candy's Room, She's The One, and a solo For You. Naturally, Peter Wolf joined in for a final encore of Dirty Water! For those of us who can indeed claim Boston as their home, it was a truly special tune. Don't think that the songs from the new album were not fantastic \u2014 they were \u2014 what, with outstanding versions of Empty Sky, Worlds Apart, You're Missing, and Into the Fire amongst others.<br/>\nAll in all, a great show. Not an empty seat in the house (an understatement), and everyone stayed until the end. A great way to ring in the fall in the northeast\u2026Bruce rocked the house tonight. Thanks to the band and the great fans at Fleet!<br/>\nBruce talks for a bit about Lenny Zakim and how people had told Bruce about him \"He lives what you sing\" (I think I might be paraphrasing here). Not a long rap, but a rap, and then they go into<br/>\nMy Hometown. I hate that I did this, but I dashed up the stairs to the bathroom. No lines, no one in the halls at all, I can't remember when I saw THAT before (of course, I wasn't out there during Fuse, Countin, Worlds Apart, etc\u2026.) Got back in under 2 minutes and Bruce had to coach the crowd just a little to get louder in their 'my hometown's. I guess a lot of people were from out of town\u2026.<br/>\nTony says 'did Bruce just sit down at the piano?'<br/>\nWhy yes, yes he just did, didn't he.<br/>\nI hear a chord and I recognize it, I know what's coming. Holy holy holy wow, I am going to experience personally Bruce Springsteen playing 'For You' on piano. And I did. And it was gooooooood. There was a guy in front of us, he was an old-school fan, heard us before the show talking about Kitty at the Christmas shows in '00 and was psyched, anyway I thought he was going to commit hari-kari right there as Bruce went into For You. Hell, I thought I was about to do that, too!<br/>\n(Oh, have to backtrack a second - during Candy's Room he changed 'driving' to 'riding' all three times. Just so you know.)<br/>\nInto the Fire - this starts differently now, Patti gets a well-deserved solo turn, singing beautiful eerie notes accompanied by Soozie on violin. Her fingers move as if she's playing an instrument, delicate, arms out in front of her, stunning to watch and hear. I'd use 'ethereal' to describe this, it's jaw-dropping gorgeous. The 'prayer' part of the song didn't seem to catch on with the crowd the way it had in New York, there wasn't a big mass of hands in the air and actually a lot of people were sitting through most of the song. At some point I had to stand and did, others were already and when I stood others did after me. There's something very mystical or quasi-religious or whatever about standing spontaneously, not standing the whole time because 'you have to stand,' but rather just getting up because you are compelled, you MUST stand up at the point in the song that calls you to personally.<br/>\nOff, back on, 'anyone want to DANCE?'<br/>\nShit, I'd forgotten how much I just love Dancing in the Dark. Steven was funny, he was pointing to people, almost and maybe a reference to the video, maybe not, but it was funny. Bruce pogo'd a lot and jeez, this just sounded so fun and great and wow, I remember that, neat! Towards the end his eyes got really big almost like his expression in the video, and his grin sort of said 'remember when I was looking like this in the video?' I was hoping he'd do 'the dance' but he didn't.<br/>\nRamrod - okay, I've said before I could really do without Ramrod, and I still feel that way except when I am actually somewhere where Bruce is actually in front of me playing Ramrod. He did do the robot and it was funny as hell!<br/>\n\"What time is it, Steve?\"<br/>\n\"It's\u2026\u2026 BOSS-ton time!\"<br/>\nWorking on the Highway - This was good, it was cool to see Gary and Steven sharing a mic, the whole country-bear-jamboree thing was cute, but really, I guess I'm just kinda' done with this song. Hell, one out of\u2026. how many did we get again? Anyway, that ain't bad.<br/>\nBorn To Run - nothing needs to be said here.<br/>\nMy City of Ruins - another mostly sitting song, again with the spontaneous 'I must stand up NOW' going on. I like being part of the Church of Bruce, and I love when I feel my 'religion' forcing me to put my hand in the air and stand because that's what I have to do at that moment.<br/>\nBITUSA - He mentioned how we're about to rush into a war. I couldn't make out everything he said, hopefully someone can get the exact quotes. Angry, awesome.<br/>\nLOHAD - Hands, pogoing, rejoicing. When it's done, he does the 'one more?' stuff and then brings on\u2026. .Peter Wolf.<br/>\n(This gets a period rather than an exclamation point because the last time Peter Wolf was onstage with Bruce in Boston, he knew none of the words to Raise Your Hand and just seemed to be a general nuisance. Regular Boston club-goers from the 1980s also are so used to seeing Peter Wolf everywhere that it's not the thrill it could be if a) he seemed like he was in touch with what was going on around him and b) if he wasn't around so much, everywhere. (This was true with Aerosmith as well for a long time, but they aren't around as much as they used to be)<br/>\nWhy Peter Wolf looks like MJ - his face was so white it looked like he was wearing white makeup, his hair was jet black, he was wearing shades and a black hat. You'll see when the pictures start showing up\u2026.<br/>\nAnyway, here comes Dirty Water (!!!!!) and it sounds great, then Peter takes the second verse and I can't believe he doesn't actually know it, perhaps he's just doing it in his own inimitable way. I dunno, in any event it's like a replay of 'Raise Your Hand' and after the break Bruce does the second verse again. By himself. And you can hear him singing the words.<br/>\nThey're playing, then they all head down the stairs, off the stage, and it's just Max playing and the whole arena singing 'love that dirty water' over and over. Then there's a red spot and Bruce is crouched down with the guitar and brings the song back up again, the stage lights come on and everyone is in position and playing, and it's a great, fun, fantastic ending to yet another in a string of incredible post-break shows!<br/>\nThey showed the Countin' on a Miracle video - is anyone going to stick around to get this onto a recording, I wonder? It's impossible to describe and there are so many people who haven't heard it, I hope they get the chance. It's very\u2026. different.<br/>\nI thought I'd have enough time to go back to the Harp for a post-show drink, but to my surprise it's 11:30!!! Did we crack 3 hours? It only seemed like 3 minutes! In any event, I have a 12:10 train and the next one is 6am, so I go have a quick look at the back side of the stage, then head down to the trains.<br/>\nI can feel the post-show depression starting, it feels like July 2, 2000, and I just want to go somewhere and cry, it was SUCH a GREAT show and I just wanted it to go on forever. But it didn't. I opt for a cigarette and gazing out at the deserted new bridge from the other side of the Fleet, then head back in to get my train. I run into KTdream, Rockaway and Happygirl and they are drained as well and we're talking but I just want to get home, get here, get whatever I can down before I start forgetting more and more. Listen to Main Point on the way back and by the time I've walked home from the train station I'm smiling and happy and still sad that it's all over now for a looooooong time but it's okay, it's not over forever. Just for now. \"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Carol Jude</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Got to my seat and was pleasantly surprised at how close it was - about mid-court, two sections or so up from the floor. A glance at the folks around me made me fear that they were 'sitters,' which in time turned out to be quite untrue! Tony/TpinMa showed a little while later and we chatted about the music playing before the show. I'd mentioned how the night before MSG I had been listening to Little Steven's show and the music playing at MSG was the same. At exactly that moment we heard 'you're listening to Little Steven's Underground Garage' over the P.A., so that was pretty cool, finding out that that's exactly what they're playing before the shows (so if you hear something you like, you can check his website and find out what it was you heard!)<br/>\nI don't know when it started, but it started. Bruce looked great of course, pin-stripe jacket over the greyish/tiny blue checked silk (?) shirt, beard looking very cool, his hair looks like there's more grey coming in, it looks 'lighter.'<br/>\nRising - excellent. No 'dream of life' from Bruce, they were very understated and sounded (to my bad ears) very much in the background. Much smoother, makes his main vocal more pronounced as there was no 'rushing around' vocally.<br/>\nLonesome Day - the first of two 'this was great but I can't think of anything to say about it' songs.<br/>\nNo Surrender - crowd, which by the way was EXCELLENT!, goes nuts, you could hear the entire place singing along, at least to the chorus. I was so happy to hear this one, I only thought of how Prove It wasn't going to be played just once!<br/>\nThe Fuse - I love The Fuse, always will, sounded cool and I'm not sure if this has always been the case, but Nils is singing along with Patti on the 'dut dut dut's, sounded, of course, great.<br/>\nWOW OH WOW OH WOW - PROVE IT!!!! In 5th position, and it sounds better coming after The Fuse than Fuse sounded coming after Prove It in previous setlists. The solo sounded like it wanted to keep going even after Max started playing the 'homestretch' drum part, and maybe it even did go on for an 'extra' measure, I'm not sure right now\u2026<br/>\nProve it ends and Tony says to me 'Candy's Room.' I look at Max and see him hitting the edge of the cymbal, and yes, that's what's coming!<br/>\nSuch a short song, yet it's so HUGE. The crowd is jumping out of their skin, we know that this is going to be another of the 'holy effing s\u2014t!!!' concerts, the energy is so high and you can see that Bruce is REALLY having a great time and feeding off the energy of the crowd.<br/>\nEmpty Sky - the woman in front of me was yakking to her friend. I waited a few long seconds to see if she'd stop, she didn't, I shhh'd her and she said 'calm down, lady, relax.' Had she been whispering and not talking, she wouldn't have bothered anyone. In any event, she shut the hell up. There were whistles but for the most part the crowd was really respectful of this and You're Missing. I remember being surprised at how 'you can hear a pin drop' quiet it was, aside from Bruce and Patti and the music. Patti was dead-on perfect and singing 'strong,' further down in her chest so she didn't sound strident or 'screechy.' Just lovely, both of them.<br/>\nWaitin' - he's confident enough, seemingly, to let us have a go at the first verse. He sang it 'low' and it seemed like everyone joined in, knew the words. Don't know if that's true with all the more recent shows, if so then very, very cool. My brain is mad at me for how much I enjoy singing this very dopey song. But it'll get over it\u2026<br/>\nPromised Land - If Bruce ever decided to drop this from the set, I would be very, very unhappy. There is no more glorious sound than the moment he comes back in on the harp after Clarence's solo, no matter what version, from what show, anywhere. It always makes me happy and it's kinda like on Cheer's when Norm comes in and everyone yells 'NORM!!!!'<br/>\nWorlds Apart - No 'la la la la li's at the beginning, just a bit of the Qwaali and then Bruce goes right into the verse. Love this song, loved it here, the ending was a fantastic jam between Bruce and Steven, Steven's guitar sounding like a cross between a violin and 'whale song,' Bruce sounding like Bruce. I wanted it to go on longer, it's funny how little they play together like that, like the old days of 'Saint in the City. Fantastic.<br/>\nBadlands, Badlands refrain RIGHT INTO She's the One - WOO-HOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>\nAgain: WOOOOOOO-HOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!<br/>\nLess pronounced She's the One keyboard riff, which was a little bit 'different' sounding and quite welcome by me. I always tend to think the keys were always just a little too loud on this, but they weren't here.<br/>\nMary's Place - Tremendous, glorious, if we had any doubts before about everyone and Bruce having a fantastic time, this certainly put them to rest (there weren't any, I just said that for emphasis). Funny part - after the intros, when the song goes soft and he's about to do the 'missing you' part, the whole arena starts doing<br/>\n'BROOOOOOOOOOCE.' He motions for us to stop (and said something, what did he say again guys?????), we do, he's crouched down with the microphone, about to sing, and we start up again, and are rewarded with a maybe-just-a-tiny-bit-exasperated smile. Then we shut up and let him start singing again. I love when it goes into the extended 'Turn it Up's - no one's sitting, I looked all around, no asses in chairs anywhere! It's another big, glorious, triumphant home run of a performance.<br/>\nCountin' - I love this song and it sounds great live but I really can't think of anything interesting to say about it. \"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Tomm Gamache</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">\"Before I present my unbiased, objective review, let me say that I didn't even know I was going to the show till 2 and 1/2 hours beforehand. I know there are a lot of Bruce fans out there, but I'd venture to say I'm one of his biggest. I'm 22 year old songwriter and the man is honestly my hero. Not because he's a superstar but because his work is truly so amazing. And I really admire and try to aspire to his amazing work ethic. He puts out music because he wants to, not to make money or push some product, he truly means what he says. My dream is to someday build a fan base like Bruce has, though I wouldn't care if I sold 12 million or 12 records. He gives me something to aspire to, a reason to always progress, and a reason to always care. Anyways\u2026 on with my review\u2026<br/>\nThe show began at 8:30 with the band each coming out on stage. The last four members came out in pairs, with Steven and Patti arm and arm, followed by the Big Man, Clarence Clemons, and Bruce. Bruce greeted the crowd and the band, accompanied by a violinist/backround vocalist, launched into a tight version of \"The Rising.\" It was exceptionally tighter than the TV performances I've seen, so I was immediately impressed. This was followed by a looser, yet impressive version of \"Lonesome Day.\" Bruce then suprised the crowd by playing \"No Surrender.\" The band's performance and crowd reaction made this one of the best numberso f the evening. Bruce then dimmed the lights, launching spots of red illumination for \"The Fuse.\" Though a lot of the audience took this as a cue for the bathrooms, it proved to be a great live number. Max kept a drum machine like feel much like on the album. The one problem was dynamics. It didn't really get louder or softer at appropriate moments which hurt the sound. Bruce then immediuately woke up the crowd with \"Prove It All Night,\" which proved to be as solid as ever. Bruce then once again suprised us be launching into \"Candy's Room,\" which soared and erupted into an arena sing-along. Bruce then did a moving version of \"Empty Sky\" followed by a spine-tingling performance of \"You're Missing.\" The band then geared up for \"Waiting on A Sunny Day,\" which seemed to replace \"Tenth Avenue Free Out\" as the tour's gospel jam and sing along. It was less tight than it should have been, but the band was really into it and it more than made up for it. Bruce then brought a personal favorite of mine, \"Promised Land\" which was a little slower than usual, but had a great drive and it really torn into the crowd. An arena shot would've have revealed at least 12,000 fists pumping in the air. Bruce follwed this with another personal favorite of mine, \"Worlds Apart\" from the new album. The much of the audience took a bathroom break on this one. While it's a great track, I have to say I preferred the album version. The crowd immediately rushed back to their seats when Bruce did his traditional chord progression before launching into \"Badlands.\" At this point, the whole arena was pumping their fists and screaming their throats hoarse. Bruce then dug \"She's The One\" from the vaults and proved that the Bo-Diddly backbeat can prove to be a great asset live. The band drew this one out, but at know point lost its intensity or interest from the audience. Another new track followed. \"Mary's Place\" is great track that really disaplyed the band's ablility to rock on the album. However, live, it was a little loose and proved to not be as strong. \"Countin On A Miracle\" proved to be both intense and hard, though it didn't arouse the audience much. Bruce then spoke to the crowd about his friend, Lenny Zakim, for whom a bridge had been dedicated in Boston earlier that day. Bruce then touched into an awe-inspiring performance of \"My Hometown.\" Bruce then suprised the crowd by sitting at the paino, and he suprised us even more b Not even two minutes later, Bruce and the band came back out and launched into an almost unrecognizable \"Dancin In The Dark\" (at least to the amateur ear). Bruce pushed it down a half step and replaced the dance beat with a slower, rock groove that proved the do the track justice. A screech of guitar then led into a bar-house run through of Ramrod, which turned into a jam. It was much like the version on Bruce's last live album. Bruce then did another \"Born in the USA\" track, this one being \"working on the Highway,\" which wasn't terribly tight. The lights then came on for \"Born to Run\" which seemed to get the crowd into a Beatles like frenzy. Bruce then left the stage again, only to return a brief moment later. He sat the piano and started \"My City of Ruins.\" He began the tune alone, but was eventually followed by the full band. Bruce then took a chance to mention some local charities (Lenny Zakim Fund, Boston Food Bank, Pediatric Aids Foundation). He then told us to remember, we're all \"born in the USA.\" They then launched into the tume, bringing the crowd into a roar that honestly hurt my ears (and I'm a guitar player and drummer). It proved to be quite an expereince to hear. Played with the passion of the original by all members of the band, it was a highlight of the night. Bruce immediately jumped into an extended version of \"Land Of Hope and Dreams.\" At this point, may assumed the show was over, only for Bruce and the band to return with local great, Peter Wolf of the J. Geils Band (\"Centerfold, \"Freeze Frame,\" \"Musta Got Lost). They then launched into the hometown favorite, \"Dirty Water\" by the Shondells. Everyone in the arena, including the band, seemed to be having the time of their lives. The band all left the stage while the song was still going, leaving Max alone to keep a beat. Everyone then came out the end and took bows, and then the show was over.<br/>\nWow, that was a mouthful. In all honesty, this was the greatest show I've ever seen (I've seen Bruce twice, Neil Young twice, Clapton twice, Tom Petty twice, The Allman Brothers twice, the Who four times, Aerosmith 4 times, The Rolling Stones 4 times, Pearl Jam, The Pretenders, the list goes on). As one can see by the accompanying parentheses, this proves to top some great company. Bruce still proves to be the best at what he does. There isn't a person who can touch his songwriting, perofmance skill, or work ethic at this point.\"</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

What a moment when Bruce was asking Patti about the chords he and the band had played every night. \"A touch of Alzheimer's\" as he said. The crowd took the brief delay to show their appreciation. BRUUUUUCE. An unbelievable roar from the crowd when Clarence threw the guitar strap back over Bruce's shoulder after what we thought was the last song and traditionally has been (Land of Hopes..) Kitty's Back to finish, Awesome. There must be a special place in Bruce's heart for Philly. The feeling is definitely mutual. We were singing every word to every song, new and old.

Bruce and the band were on fire from the moment they hit the stage, which kept the crowd enthused for the entire show. Songs from The Rising were performed with such passion and intensity, that one couldn't help but be swept away by their emotional impact and spiritual uplifting. Along the way there were also some nice surprises. \"For You\" was performed as if it were a brand new song, the band presented a powerful version of that old classic. One of the night's highlights had to be Bruce's piano version of \"Incident\". Without a doubt that performance had to be one of the most beautiful I'd ever heard and it would be a shame if it never ended up being recorded on a live cd. And as if that weren't enough, after Bruce and the band blasted through \"Born to Run\" and \"Born in the USA\", they deliver an awesome, rocking, bring-down-the-house version of \"Kitty's Back\". All I can say, is that Bruce and the band are playing each show with that same passion and commitment they have become famous for. The shows are intense, moving and without a doubt, nothing short of a religious experience. Thanks Bruce and Est band for a show that went way beyond any expectations.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Bill</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">This was my first show of this tour, but I obviously knew going in that this was going to be a different kind of Bruce show than any I have seen. Having seen some 20-odd Philly shows over the years, I've come to expect the unexpected and as usual I was not disappointed. We all know the setlist by now and it was fantastic, but more than that was the crowd. Philly fans are always great, but last night was the loudest I can ever remember. People around here say that the FU Center isn't as loud as the Spectrum was, and until last night I would have agreed, but when Bruce put the guitar strap back around his neck after waving goodbye and launched into Kitty's Back (with a short pause to find a guitar that worked!) you could almost feel the building rocking, a truly spine tingling moment. And to think, I didn't have a ticket until Saturday morning when my best Bruce Bud called to tell me that he had scored 2\u00a0GA tickets at Ticketron that morning. Unbelievable. What is also unbelievable is that Bruce can pull out a song that is some 27 years old and its the first time I've ever heard it live (Night). Also a first was the impromptu onstage rehearsal when Bruce forgets how to play Empty Sky, classic Bruce moment. As for the new material, for the most part it works beautifully live, (the For You/ Worlds Apart segue was a little rough around the edges, Mary's Place is awful( he should have given that one to Grushecky), and Countin' just sort of lays there but they are minor quibbles). All in all, it has to rank among the best shows I've ever seen, but I say that after every show, LOL.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Joe</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Bruce captures the \"streets of Philadelphia\" once again\u2026\u2026 Bruce exploded on to the stage of the First Union Center in his usual fashion Sunday night. From the start of this near three hour show, fans and newcomers alike were caught in the magic of this night. It seemed as if everyone knew the words to songs of new and old. Bruce's piano solos of Streets of Philadelphia and Incident on 57th Street with added vocals of Patti, Niles, and Soozie were outstanding. However these were not the only surprises. Bruce continued to surprise the crowd with songs: For You, Bus stop 82nd street, and the final song of the night, Kitty's Back. This was truly an unforgettable performance by Bruce &amp; The E-Street Band. The impression left on this crowd by Bruce was seen throughout the night in Philly. Echoes of \"Spanish Johnny\" rang from cars at Philadelphia's renown cheese steak place, Pat's Steaks, as fans and customers satisfied their hunger and placed requests into the early morning.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Mike</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">PHILLY RISING\u2026Not only was Streets of Philadelphia, Incident on 57th St, Does this Bus Stop\u2026, and Kitty's Back major surprises, but Bruce also did a full band version of For you!

I've seen 30+ shows over the years, and this was definitely among the top 5!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Ray Cascella</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">What a great show! You could just look at the setlist and see that. \"The Rising\" is a great album and even better when done live. The place was rockin' with great classics like \"Does This Bus Stop at 82nd St?\", \"For You\". \"Incident on 57th St.\" and \"She's The One\". The best was yet to come with a very special surprise of \"Kitty's Back\" added on the encore, just for Philly. Thanks Bruce!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>Jack the Balloon Man</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Show started about 8:20. after The Rising &amp; Lonesome Day, he broke out Night, which I don't recall hearing live since maybe 77. Further On Up the Road, was a real treat and one of my favorite songs on the CD. Bruce steps up to the microphone and gives us a \"Hello Philly, great to be back, we have some surprises for you, but we need some quiet on this song\". So he begins to strum a little on his acoustic and stops, steps away and at this point we're all thinking \"Holy shit! This is going to be sensational if THEY can't even remember it\". It takes a few minutes, a few band huddles and Bruce steps up again and makes a remark about Alzheimer's, and the laughter, and the ensuing \"Bruuuucue\" made him forget again. All that, and FINALLY the started Empty Sky! Uhh Bruce\u2026 This is the 20th time you played that this tour. Maybe it is Alzheimer's. Now from where I was sitting, I thought the sound quality was excellent. This was about the best version of You're Missing, I've heard this tour. Waitin' on a Sunny Day was it's usual upbeat and fun, and the Philly crowd is Loud and sings on key, so that was fun. Does This Bus Stop at 82nd Street? Came next and rocked. Than he goes deep in the vault and pulls out a full band For You! Haven't heard that one live (like that) since 78 or so. He cut the beginning intro to Worlds Apart, but it still sounded good, Badlands as usual kicked ass, and really rocked on the audience part, especially at the end. He then goes for a BTR classic and breaks out She's the One, (For Horley2) and a raucous Mary's Place, followed by Countin' on a Miracle. At this point, he walks over, sits at the piano, and breaks out Streets of Philadelphia, with Steve, Patty &amp; Soozie doing the \"Li,li,li,li\" part. That was cool but than when he stays there and begins Incident on 57th Street, I hit the roof. (literally, I was 5 rows from the roof). I have been to well over 40 shows and have NEVER heard this one live. It is truly one of my favorite songs., I was stunned. The introduction to Into The Fire is different than earlier in the tour. They set it up with a sort of rumbling sound. So they leave and come back with Dancing in the Dark. Bruce is jumping up and down as he plays the guitar. Ramrod kicks live like always, lights up for Born to Run, hands in the air, loud audience of course, My City of Ruins, thoughts go out to the Greater Philadelphia Food Bank, and he intro's Born in the USA with thought on pending war with Iraq, and how no matter which side we are on regarding this issue, it's best not to rush in. Land of Hope and Dreams closed things out or so we thought. He waves, thanks the audience, waves some more, holds the guitar up. (he's teasing us now) Finally, Clarence pushes the guitar back on Bruce's shoulder, he steps up to the Mike and says \"Only in Philadelphia\" and than poof\u2026 nothing\u2026. wrong guitar. He rushes back to get the right one and launches Kitty's Back. How fitting and what a great way to end one of the best shows of the Rising tour. I have long thought that Bruce squeezes out and extra something for Philly for two reasons. One: Philadelphia was the first area OUTSIDE his home base to embrace him. He was getting radio play here long before anywhere else. He'll never forget that. The other thing is Philly is a \"no pressure\" site for him. Two: The crowd here just takes his word for it. He could mail it in and he would still get the same reaction form the Philly faithful. They never come in with the \"OK Bruce, dazzle us\" attitude that I see in NYC and North Jersey. It's the same thing (like Philly) in Boston. The most touching thing about the whole weekend was that 75% of the people there got their tickets through the kindness of Lakers. Kindness pays off in the City of Brotherly Love. Many thanks go out to all those that contributed, the lovely Mrs. Balloon Man for allowing me to spend so much time with things and people that I love. Boss Man Bob, I hope this is not the end of the ride. We'll see you \"Further on up the Road\", RIGHT?????\"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>Rube1859</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">\n<p>Ok, well my trip to Philly started off in good fashion, arriving there at midnight to join the drop line b/c I was ticketless. When I got there I got number 41. I was high in spirits and I even chose to stick the night out on line instead of sleeping in my car and meeting at check in times. There were drag racers running up and down Pattisson the whole night so finding a parking spot was quite a pain. But being awake all night we got to see some cool stuff. At about 4:40 three big rigs rolled down Broad street off of 95. A member of event staff came out said something into his walkie talkie and then BAMM, every light at the FU center and the lot went dark. We realized these were the rigs carrying all the equipment. The same thing happened about 30 minutes later when 4 more trucks pulled in with the rest of the equipment. One kid was even holding onto one riding his skateboard trying to get into the venue but to no avail. Check in for GA was 7 and Drop line was 7:15. At 6:45 you could see the masses coming down Broad Street for check in. For a while there during the night I was running the drop getting all the names in line and numbering people since the two guys who were doing it before me went to sleep. After role call I walked back to my car and rolled up into a blanket to warm up. But I fell asleep. Thank goodness this family I met saw me sleeping and woke me up at 9:10 for 9:30 role call. It was quite a sprint from the Holiday Inn Parking lot back to the FU Center.<br/>\nAt the 9:30 role call we started to receive more info and that we should stay in line. At 10AM they led the drop line in towards the box office getting hopes up for all of us. The GA line followed behind and received their wristbands (At 10 AM no less). There were plenty of scalpers around and they were so obvious. The hourly role calls showed that the line was dwindling and fast. By 3 PM about 15 people had fallen out of line ahead of me, but at the same time the line was growing by leaps and bounds. As the hours passes I got a little more desperate and was holding one finger up to every car that passed me in hopes of an extra ticket. One scalper did peek my interest, only b/c he told me where he lived and it was around the corner from me, and I'm about an hour away from Philly. I still wasn't going to pay over face value though.<br/>\nAt about 4:45 security came out and said no tickets will be dropped for the show which sent a few people packing but we decided to stick the line out. At 5:30, previously mentioned scalper came to me and said he was going to sell me that ticket at face value since he was having trouble finding buyers but one guy who posts on LD a lot got it first. (Name meant something I guess). At this point people ahead of me in the drop line were able to find some extra tickets and gave me the liost to start running the line again. We decided to do 6\u00a0O'clock role call and I started. The scalper again came to me and said I found a guy with 1 ticket for a hundred. I said let me do the line first since it was my responsibility, and he said ok. Then two minutes later he was ok \"I'm doing you a favor you want it for 100 or not\" I said \u2026\u2026.. NO. I said I'm sticking with the line. Then a minute later security walks out and tells us to line up, they have 100\u00a0GA's. I get in my spot and give them the list to check over to make sure people don't cut. There were people who were walking up trying to cut saying the drop line wasn't fair since they couldn't get here in time to get a good number (Too bad). They took us in 3 at a time and we could purchase 2 tickets at max. I was about number 9 at this point b/c of all the defections. When that ticket hit my hands I almost cried b/c I had been waiting around 18 hours for this.<br/>\nI'll skip the line mostly but I met this really nice woman who actually knows Bruce and we were sharing stories, she mentioned his trainer in description, and about 5 minutes later she goes \"That's him\" and it was, matched the description and all and he knew who she was and said he'd give it a try for her and me and these two other people to move into the pit.<br/>\nI get onto the floor and am about 1/3 of the way back, and you can feel the excitement of the crowd. I was looking at the clock in the arena and it was exactly 8:20 when the light went down and Philly erupts. We get to standard opening two but the floor is rocking. (It definitely is much better on the floor considering I've sat in the seats twice so far) Then Bruce rips into Night and we go crazy, the floor lit up, hands waving. Amazing. When he followed this with FOUTR we couldn't believe the setlist we were getting. he told us he had a few surprises in store for Philly and that it was gonna rock. He was about the do Empty sky and he's standing there and goes \"\"I forgot how to play this song\"\" So he rushes to the side behind Patti. He, Patti, Steven and Nils are trying to remember how to play it and they are all there holding the guitar strumming trying to get it right.<br/>\nFinally it hits him and he comes over says \"Early Alzheimer's\" and starts playing it. We got the typical You're Missing and Waitin' on a Sunny Day. The crowd was great during Sunny Day IMO. At this point I did realize I had one guy behind me who was a pain yelling the whole night \"Bruce, what happened to the effin chicken man\" even yelling it at one point when Bruce was talking before MCOR.<br/>\nThen the band started playing again and no one knew what song it was until those first words, \"Hey bus driver\u2026.\" Bonkers, plain bonkers. And when he followed it with For You, I knew I couldn't last this show. Bruce was going to pound each and everyone one of us with amazing songs tonight and he did. I was wobbly at this point. (Not sure if it was the 1 hour sleep in the past 36 hours or just the show I like to say the show.) World's Apart was good, and sounded better than usual, probably b/c there was no intro, he just went into it.</p>\n<p>Badlands, She's the One and Mary's Place had the crowd kicking and screaming with delight. I couldn't believe it. I was exhausted and Bruce was only half way done. Maybe he knew were going crazy and needed to calm up a little, maybe not but he followed it with Countin' on a Miracle. No matter what people say, I like this song, and so did the people in the drop line around me, we discussed it for a while and why it seems it has a bad rap.<br/>\nThe people were definitely sitting down in the seats, but it was at this point I looked up and saw more people then I thought I would. Above the upper level, there was a row of people standing practically in the rafters encircling the entire arena. I don't know if these were employees or fans without tix at discounted prices but to see the fact that they were practically in the rafters showed me how much they wanted to see Bruce play.<br/>\nThen Bruce walked to the piano. I was hoping for Incident and said it to the guy next to me He said \"Maybe or Racing in the Street\" When I saw Patti and Nils and Suzie come out I knew it wasn't Incident, but it turned out to be Streets of Philadelphia. The crowd was loving it signing along and everything (Suzie and Nils blocked Patti out at the Mike, couldn't even see her since they were so close to it.) Then he finished and I was like time to bring the band back out, but no, those three leave the stage, and he shuffles through some papers. Not two solos in a row you've got to be kidding me, this is great. He says this is for Lexie if I can remember it and then \"Spanish Johnny drove in from the underworld last night\u2026\" Crazy. It was amazing I was crying at this point I think. We sang every word and Bruce was wondering if he could remember it. I knew this was a special show.<br/>\nAfter Incident came to an end (sadly) Patti and the rest of the band came out. Patti had an operesque solo and let me say something her voice is vastly improved. A little to much movement by here with the arms but the voice is much better. Then they kicked into \"Into the Fire\" and it was so moving. The way the crowd interacted and held strong and sang every last line with him was so moving.<br/>\nWhen the band came back for the encores Bruce goes \"Are you ready to dance?\" This version of Dancing in the Dark is great, now doubt to it, sounds great with the guitars wailing. Then the guitar got slid across the mike stand and signaled it was time to Ramrod. Bruce was so into it. running around the stage, swinging the guitar around his neck, shaking his ass with Clarence. Damn. Then the count down \"ONE, TWO\u2026\" Lights full blast and Born to Run. Seeing every fist in the arena pump, even those in the last row was undeniably one of the greatest things I have ever seen. At this point I was actually asking that he not come back and do a second encore b/c I couldn't make it, I had nothing left, my voice was shot my arms hurt, my legs were sore.<br/>\nBut I knew he was coming back and I'd have to do it. I wasn't going to argue anyway. MCOR was beautiful. Except the guy behind me yelling for the chicken man in the middle of the song. I wanted to turn around and say \"Hey he got blown up in Philly so he's not going to be here.\" The civil rights speech was definitely one of the better ones, a little more detailed than earlier on the tour and a great response from the crowd before BITUSA. He can play that song with all the emotion of a 36 year old Bruce playing it, it's incredible. Then they went into LOHAD and told us raise our hands for it, we were part of this train. He's going on and on. I love this song and I know why now. I don't want this train ride to stop, I wanted Bruce to do this all night.<br/>\nThe band finishes up and are ready to leave but clarence puts the Guitar back on Bruce and Bruce goes \"One more\" for you Philly. And it was Kitty's Back. I will tell you the truth. I never really got this song on the album but hearing it live made me a believer. It just went on and on. I couldn't sing the words, mt voice was gone but I was into it with everyone with our hands flying and stomping on the floor. When it finally ended, I didn't know what to do I mingled on the floor for a while and found some of the others who stuck out the drop line with me. I said best show of this tour and a phenomenal Bruce show overall. They tended to agree. When I finally got back this morning and looked at the setlist I was shocked to see it was only 24 songs, It felt so much longer. But I can say one thing. Last night was not just a great show. I was an experience for everyone of us in that arena. We all witnessed a special show last night and we knew it. I can't go on anymore, I think I'm babbling. But I got in after having the faith to sit on the drop line for 18 hours when so many gave up hope. Faith most certainly was rewarded. When someone saw my face they asked how I got o burnt I explained and their simple response was \"God bless you for doing that, it takes a lot to wait 18 hours at a show w/o tickets and then get them\" All I can say is it was worth it.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Cal</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Kitty's Back and Incident - Enough said!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I sat in the upper deck with a friend who said he thought it was a better show than the November '99 Buffalo show in which he and I were in the 12th row center. It was certainly as good a show from my point of view and I think part of that is because of his belief in his new music. The Rising songs all sounded great live, and more people were familiar with the album than I had expected. The Bruce-on-piano version of Lost in the Flood was a treat, as was Tougher than the Rest, and a great finish with Working on a Highway. The acoustic Born in the USA during the Reunion Tour was a favorite of mine, but I'm very partial to the electric version in this show. Something about the vocal reminds me of the acoustic version. It's just a different color than the old electric version and is a fresh approach. I didn't see anyone walking out during Land of Hope and Dreams or during Highway, which I had seen happen on the Reunion Tour more than once, although a friend told me afterward that he heard two people in a bar who had left because Bruce hadn't played enough old songs. (Yeah, just like I heard someone at a Joad show complaining that that wasn't a rock show.) I also thought the sound in this show was better than the four Reunion shows I saw, and Bruce was in excellent voice. Another friend of mine at the show, who hadn't seen him since the River tour, almost didn't go because of the price and because he thought the Rising songs would make it a somewhat subdued show. He quickly realized it was going to be a great show. \"Bruce never disappoints,\" I said, and he nodded enthusiastically.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>Scooter007</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">The day started out at 3 in the morning, after breakfast and a few stops we got to the arena around 6am, I was surprised to find out that there were already 71 people in front of me, but 72 got me second row, rite in between clarence and Nils. The GA line was ran pretty well, despite a few problems from arena security everything seemed fine.<br/>\nWe finally got inside around 6:30-ish and we secured our spots on the floor, made friends with a few people around us so that when we left the floor to go wonder we would be able to get our spots back\u2026at my guess Bruce came on around 830 or so and it was about time, it made those last 13 hours outside in the cold and wind well worth it. He seemed very energetic, much to the crowds delight and he really rocked out the rising and lonesome day, we got darkness in the third spot which was great even though I was anticipating prove it.<br/>\nThe show slowed down for a few after that with your missing and empty sky. it was really touching to see how much these songs mean to all of them, clarence couldn't hold back the tears throughout your missing. the show picked up rite after that with waiting on a sunny day, I do like that song on the cd but WOW, what a tune to hear live, it was definitely one of the highlights of the night. after that we got the tour premiers of you can look but you better not touch and tougher than the rest, it was very nice surprises. no surrender followed and he continued to rock through the set\u2026..<br/>\nThe first encore started with dancing\u2026I love the full band rock version of it, during the song he came over to our side and and rite before the \"hey baby\" part he commented on my girlfriends shirt (it said jersey girl) and when he pointed at her they were so close I thought he was gonna pull a Courtney Cox, I would have had a heart attack. that was so cool because i have bever had good eye contact at a show with anyone in the band before this show, we got a wink from Nils and throughout the whole show we kept goofing around with clarence, and of course the Bruce moment\u2026 I'll never forget that. ramrod was awesome and born to run blew the top off the HSBC Arena, it was soo loud in there. the second encore started with my city, i love that song and you could see how much Bruce believes in it\u2026my arms were in the air for so long throughout that song I thought my hands were gonna go dead. LoHaD came along and i that meant we were going to be wrapping it up, I love that song as a closer, its definitely one of my favorite. I don't know it was planned but they scrambled around and bust out the guitars for one more, working on the highway\u2026 he said since this was the last one on that states for a while we were gonna get one more\u2026 hey this is buffalo we deserve it\u2026if we have to have to suffer through disappointing sports teams why not a have the best rock\u2026.concerts and that was what Bruce gave us\u2026 I was so happy for my friends with me who were seeing him for the first time live\u2026 they are truly hooked now. I don't know how he can play with that amount of energy night after night but we truly all blessed to be a part of it\u2026 I was exhausted after the show\u2026 I don't know he does but I hope it never stops\u2026 Thanks Bruce for another wonderful night.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Dana</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">For what it is worth\u2026. Here is my take on last night, and forgive me for the comparison to the Detroit show. A HUGE THANKS TO MIRIAM AND TAMMY who made it all possible!!!<br/>\nThe Rising - Nice surprise to see Patti is now doing the (a dream of life) echoes where in Detroit, Bruce was trying to get it all in. Love this song as the opener.<br/>\nLonesome Day - From my perspective, I saw this as a tight sounding song. Nils was electrifying<br/>\nDarkness - Still sends tingles by down my spine but I know I was greatly anticipating what he was going to play here and I admit to feeling a little disappointed.<br/>\nFurther On Up the Road - This made up for what I was looking for in Darkness. I was really anticipating this one live and I wasn't disappointed. Great guitar work! I was sitting rear stage, and it was after this song that Bruce lost the jacket.<br/>\nEmpty Sky - loved the reference to the flub in Philly, he tapped his head and nodded that he was in total control tonight! I did find it to still be quite noisy - which people could resist the urge to yell out and/or whistle<br/>\nYour Missing - As much as I loved the SNL version, I truly enjoyed Soozie on this one.<br/>\nWaiting On a Sunny Day - I really enjoyed the gradual build up\u2026 The playing with the crowd (lucky fans in front of Clarence where he dropped to his knees) and the band. Saw him soak his knees, and knew that a slide was in order. He didn't disappoint as he slide from in front of Patti to center stage where Clarence was waiting. In a word - FUN!!!<br/>\nYou Can Look But You'd Better Not Touch - Awesome! Steve and Bruce really seemed to enjoyed going back and forth on this one! As an aside after the concert 96.9 was broadcasting a replay of the Buffalo concert - or so they said\u2026. The dead giveaway was the version they played of this song contain \"went Christmas shopping, down at the mall, started looking, that was all\"<br/>\nNo Surrender - like the mix of the band and then down to an acoustic section of just Bruce and his words<br/>\nWorlds Apart - Soozie, Soozie, Soozie<br/>\nBadlands - Everything and more!<br/>\nShe's The One - I may be wrong here\u2026 But I thought I detected a flub on words in this one\u2026 \"Because French cream won't soften them boots And French kisses will not break that heart of stone\" Anyone else agree? I thought he missed the French kiss line entirely\u2026..<br/>\nMary's Place - Best house party in Buffalo that I could find!<br/>\nCounting On A Miracle - not bad but a nice sprig of feedback part way thru made me cringe a little<br/>\nTougher Than the Rest - This just made me smile! What a wonderful surprise - made me sooo thankful that I made the trip to Buffalo<br/>\nLost In The Flood - in a word 'AWESOME', I am really enjoying the piano playing!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>\nInto The Fire - scorching\u2026 Patti's harmonizing was on fire<br/>\nDancing in the Dark - the other one that I was anticipating as I had hoped from reading the posts to see it live. Definitely having way too much fun with this one. Great facial expression.<br/>\nRamrod - It's BOSS TIME<br/>\nBorn To Run - WAY BETTER IN BUFFALO, sorry Detroit - this crowd ROCKED<br/>\nMy City in Ruins - \"\"with these hands\"\"\u2026. Could so easily become \"with these fans\" - do you not think he had us doing what he wanted?<br/>\nBorn In the USA - Blistering as usual<br/>\nLand of Hopes and Dreams - I didn't want to hear the beginning of this - knowing that the end was near\u2026..<br/>\nWorking on the Highway - Too much fun - wish we could have gotten more from him. Loved the washboard scrubbing Clarence! Danny with the accordion\u2026.<br/>\nIt was a great night - counting the weeks till TORONTO now\u2026.. After 2 rear stage views of the concert - I can't wait to see it from the pit!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

In my opinion, this was the first time, I can say that the performance reached exactly the same quality of the American shows I had attended before. And in comparison to 1999, when I hated the bad audience, this time we were part of a fantastic crazy crowd, which is not normal in Berlin at all. Everywhere on the floor and the upper seats the people sang and shook their booties during the entire 2 ? hours it was a terrific hot vibration, which probably infected the band to reach an unique non-stop 150% energy level. So we could listen to a wonderful setlist with many long long expected rarities. For sure it was definitely a greatest-hits show, but there were plenty of hand-clapping, arm-waving favorites to send us fans into wild ecstasy. Springsteen opened with a friendly Hallo Berlin, Hallo Deutschland and started as usual with The Rising and \"Lonesome Day\" but this time followed by an very powerful \"The Ties That Bind\" and one of the best. \"Atlantic City\" I have ever heard (my true opinion) But also the Rising-songs which still filled nearly the half set now sounded live even better than in Phoenix two months ago. I only missed Further Up On The Road from the new album. Bruce announced \"The Promise\" as a special song for Berlin which was followed by Incident\u2026 on solo piano as well. My further favorites of this night were. Dancing, My City Of Ruins and an extended show version of Ramrod . I am so glad about Bruce promise, to see us all again next year in summer.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Lena</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Last night s concert in Berlin was a well organized peaceful event, where almost everything went smooth. The arena has been recently baptized into the Berlin Arena, aka the Velodrom. You can see that it is a biking arena, the futuristic architecture has a slight coldness to it, not to mention uncomfortable seats. Situated in the middle of an Eastern Berlin housing area close to the old slaughter house the Arena itself is a semi underground circular complex which takes up to 12000 people.<br/>\nAll of them must have been there last night needless to say, it was full. Ticket hawkers circled the premises as we got there around seven. There were virtually no lines, only a fast body check that would have missed anything below waist line.<br/>\nAs the audience slowly filled the vacant seats and the lighting technicians climbed the roof riggs, block 8 took the initiative to a few successful waves around the arena. People soon got tired of this though and as the clock approached 8.30 we were ready for some serious rock and roll.<br/>\nThe first two songs showed that the new album has taken a firm grip of the musical hearts of the audience. Tight and powerful this was a great start to a trip through Springstenian history. There seemed to be room for all that has passed under the bridge since 1973. The first old number, close in sound to the original version caused nostalgia Atlantic City. Springsteen sang slightly changed lyrics in the refrain. Everybody dies, baby that s a fact\u2026 It took the song closer to an audience that was essentially middle aged. Not many faces looked under 30.<br/>\nAfter a solemn beginning the Band took us to the party song Waiting for a Sunny Day. Obviously this song has the capacity of getting almost everybody to their feet shaking their dance boot. This part of the concert warmed up the arena. Worlds Apart was played with an Irish touch, here Soozie Tyrell showed her best on the electric fiddle. From now one Bruce had us in his pocket. When asked to be quiet for two songs, the same as on the previous tour, the audience instantly calmed down.<br/>\nAfter a short break for about twenty seconds (how do they do it???) the second set started. To my opinion there was more freedom, more joy at this point. The wild mix of old and new settled the impression that neither Springsteen nor the E Street Band are afraid of the past. Not even of the grossly misinterpreted and politically coopted Born in the USA is threatening. Bruce introduced this song in a heartbreakingly sweet German. Dieses Lied war \u00fcber den Krieg. Jetzt singe ich es f\u00fcr den Frieden. Bruce, your German is great! Max Weinberg imitated the sound of machine guns and bombs in a frenetic solo that closed the song. So Born in the USA is being reclaimed on this tour, hopefully it will work out.<br/>\nInsufficient lightning caused people to fall head first down the stairs even after only a beer or two. With some people having had far more than that, I was unlucky to have a moron coming in directly behind me screaming his lungs out when the subtle soft piano chords in two songs nur f\u00fcr Berlin were played by Bruce alone. Incident on 57th Street was a wonderful meandering experience only disturbed by the moron who obviously craved for percussion. I had decided on placing my fist firmly on his chin and the subsequent statement for the police: He disturbed the concert. Only his safety distance saved him.<br/>\nBadlands and Born to Run were loudly appreciated, especially the classic sax solos by Clarence Clemons. All in all he was the favorite band member among the Berliners. He wore some kind of extended version Femina sign in gold around the neck whose meaning I couldn't decipher. At this point Bruce started climbing the mike stand (how did it hold??) and did some rock n roll ass wiggling in front of an ecstatic audience. Especially the women appreciated this gesture. The musicians transcended their gray hair and sometimes baldish heads into a forever young and wild crew ready to play into eternity. Mary s Place was the best and the most sovereign performance going from crescendo to andante and back again, transferring us to a live party, making everyone sing along.<br/>\nThis show of real professionalism paired with passion is really the credo of the concert. And the humor came through in one of the most personal moments during the song Thunder Road when the audience took over the lyric lines\u2026 show a little faith there s magic in the night, you ain't a beauty but hey you re all right\u2026 he laughed about this somewhat double-edged compliment as if it was from us to him.<br/>\nThat wrapped it all up. Everyone had been awesome, Patti got a sunflower from somebody in the front line. Outside the full moon had come out, temperature was down to 3 degrees as I went home to chill out with some whisky and music from the Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle. And I hope they don t stop doing what they just did. It gives us all hope.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I am only 16 years old, and though I have not been a fan for as long as most, I am still a huge fan.. I had people 20 years older than me tapping me on the shoulder and asking me 'what song is this?' when Bruce was playing \"Incident\" , I was one of the few people near me that knew every lyric to every song played. It was a great show, Bruce completely blew me away. I had seen the NYC show on HBO and thought it was great, but it had no comparison to the show I saw. Seeing Don Henley come out was awesome. The entire show was great, I can still remember every minute of it. I can't wait to see him again. Bruce jumping on the piano, sliding across the stage on his knees. Just awesome.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>dapchi</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">What a blast! Thanks Bruce, I had so much fun.<br/>\nFirst off, apologies to the lady sitting next to me (section 117, row F, seat 17). I think I blew her eardrum out when Bruce intro'd Ramrod.<br/>\nApologies also to my wife. During Nils' intro to Countin', she was telling me she was worried about her hand, which she hurt in a fall Friday evening. When Bruce said, \"It's A\" I stood and began jamming out in my own world, oblivious to the pain of my loved one. Need to figure out how to make it up to her.<br/>\nThe band came on at around 8:15 PM. The seats in the arena looked pretty full from my vantage point, especially the upper levels. Plenty of room on the floor around the sound board.<br/>\nI thought the crowd was pretty reserved. Lots of people leaving the floor and coming back with food and drink. We were right near an aisle so this was particularly distracting. Lot's of sitting in my section including two guys who did not want to be there. Surprisingly, no one bitched about those who were standing.<br/>\nEarly in the set, acoustics were not great. On several occasions I could hear echo bouncing off the back wall of the arena. I'm assuming someone else heard and fixed it because I didn't notice it after Darkness.<br/>\nDuring The Rising, I noticed Patti's vocals are vastly improved from The Reunion Tour. Gone are the days of I'm just a mumble doll.<br/>\nHad mixed feelings when Darkness was played. On one hand I was glad because I missed it during the reunion tour due to a toilet break. On the other hand, I was worried I wouldn't hear any non Rising songs that I hadn't heard before. This may have been an audible, as Bruce was talking to Steve before it was played. Can anyone elaborate?<br/>\nEmpty Sky &amp; You're Missing was very moving. I really looked forward to this part of the show and wasn't disappointed. What is Patti doing with her hand when she's singing? I'm surprised more than one person didn't yell out after the \"eye for an eye\" on Empty sky<br/>\nThe WOASD sing along was pretty sorry, prompting Bruce to comment that he thought there were more people in Texas.<br/>\nVery surprised to hear Night. Wasn't sure what it was until two or three notes into Clarence's opening solo.<br/>\nWas disappointed so many people used FOUTR for a break. It was like someone announced free beer at the concession stands.<br/>\nBruce had to push the crowd at the end of Badlands before playing the \"outro\".<br/>\nI don't care much for She's The One but Max is so powerful on this song live. I loved watching him play tonight.<br/>\nI told my wife that I predicted we'd get a solo The Angel tonight. She was much more happy that we got Incident instead. This is a song that I've yet to learn to appreciate, but I really enjoyed it tonight.<br/>\nI know it starts slow, but Into The Fire is such a powerful piece of work. Bruce sounds like he's weeping when he sings, \"I need your kiss.\"<br/>\nThe band left the stage for 45-60 seconds tops, before coming back. Bruce asked if we were ready for a Texas Two-Step and played DITD.<br/>\nRamrod. So much fun, including Bruce asking Steve if it was quitting time so they could go back to the hotel and watch pornographic movies.<br/>\nBTR. Houselights up. What else can I say?<br/>\nWhen the band left after BTR, I saw an extra mic stand placed on the stage, so I knew we were in for a treat. I don't know why, but I never guessed Don Henley would be the guest. I Fought The Law was soooo fuckin' cool!!!<br/>\nMCOR was played for the North Texas Food Bank. I just don't understand how people can sit through this song. Oh well, we all enjoy in our own ways.<br/>\nBITUSA was intro'd with Bruce saying we should all pray for peace.<br/>\nWas able to pogo during LOHAD as the people next to me left after BITUSA. I love the People Get Ready piece.<br/>\nI knew we would get at least one more song and when Bruce got his acoustic I knew it would be something different. Bruce, wearing a cowboy hat from someone in the pit, broke out Working. Towards the end of the song, Nils was playing what looked like a banjo, Danny the accordion and Clarence a washboard. That song is so much fun live.<br/>\nThe band left the stage, the houselights came up and I reflected on what I'd just seen; a Bruce gig with Incident, but no Thunder Road, Don Henley for a guest on I Fought The Law and Working On The Highway as the show closer. Who woulda' think it? Looking forward to hearing the boot from this one.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">David Lind</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">I thought the show was superb. I was in the crow's nest, and it is a little hard to immerse yourself from there. On the other hand, the view of the stage in its entirety was very good, if distant. The arena was full, with the exception of the floor, which was 2/3 full AT MOST. Maybe they sold as many tickets as were permitted for the floor but everyone crowded up front. Any ideas? The sound contained too much bass for the first few songs, but it was OK by the time of the Empty Sky and You're Missing. Bruce asked for quiet on these songs, and he got it. Very well performed with Patty (why do some people seem to want to give her a hard time?) and very poignant. I was amazed by inclusion of my 3 favorite older songs (Darkness On The Edge Of Town, Promised Land, &amp; Badlands) and thought the song choices were superb. I really couldn't have wished for a better show; just better seats. I saw the band 2.5 years ago in New Orleans, and I thought this show was much more polished if a bit less rollicking for the first hour. Maybe it was my remoteness from the stage.<br/>\nI hope others enjoy the tour as much as I did.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Bob Billman</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">It seems Bruce really gets up for his shows in Dallas. He always seems to be a little more fired up here. I keep thinking he will soon begin to show his age, lose a step, or not hit the notes. He just keeps getting better. Once again, he was sensational. I was excited to hear FOURTH. The crowd was relatively reserved. Many families getting their kids to see the Boss and R&amp;R history. The Rising and Lonesome were fantastic opens. Henley was a nice touch but didn't do much for me. I felt that Cadillac Ranch last tour was a better closing song than WOTH. However, isn't it true that the last song is always one too few no matter how long the setlist.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Highlights were \"For You\" piano solo, \"No Surrender\", and \"Born to Run\" with all the lights in the place on. Weird at first, but it was actually kind of cool. Also, they did a little Cajun rendition of \"Working on the Highway\" at the end with a washboard and Bruce wearing a John Popperesque hat. This show had much more excitement than the last Houston show a couple years ago. The general admission floor helped out a lot. The last show was all assigned seating. Sadly, there were no new tour songs played, but hopefully I'll get a surprise in Austin tomorrow night. Ran into a couple ladies wearing \"greasylake.org\" t-shirts.

Seemed like he was going through the motions on Dancing in the Dark though. Working on the Highway was great, and a fitting way to end the show as we all trudged back home to get ready for work the next morning. Notable in their absence were Thunder Road, Promised Land, Prove It All Night, Spirit in the Night, Because the Night. Nothing off of Lucky Town. No idea why No Surrender was included. Darkness is my favorite album, and I don't think we heard more than Badlands from it. Would have preferred Candy's Room to She's The One, for the infatuation song. Fabulous vocal duet with Boss and Patti to open Empty Sky. Ties That Bind was hard rockin'. Ramrod was fun, despite the repetitive chord progression. Bruce seemed deeply moved on Empty Sky and You're Missing. Waitin' on a Sunny Day was a great way to gently ease us out of the grief of those prior two songs. Gary Tallent was WAY TOO LOUD the whole show. Don't know how the sound folks missed this. During parts of nearly every tune, he covered up the entire band. The crowd was so calm after Into The Fire that it seemed a strange point to end the main body of the show.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Kevin G.</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">It was my first time seeing Bruce. Everyone told me how awesome it was going to be, but the real thing just blew away any of the hype. Springsteen has that once-in-a-generation ability to just put on a live show that blows people's minds. I'm only sorry that I was born in the 80's and missed most of Springsteen's original work. The poetry of the songs and the passion with which he plays and the talent with which he surrounds himself with all climaxes into two and a half hours of the best live music anyone could ever see, anywhere. Choosing his best song of the night is a near impossible feat. \"Lonesome Day\" was great but \"Into the Fire\" was even better. \"For You\" was really special and so was \"Land of Hope and Dreams\". However, I think the way he did his closing song, \"Working on the Highway\", made it the night's best. What a performance, what a band, what a musician.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Bruce left there a tad late and rushed to head back to the center ramp (on Max's right) to return to the stage but he turned one step too soon. Luckily, as he strode forward, his right leg landed on the down-ramp first but when he went to land his left leg, it hit nothing but air as it completely missed the ramp. He had not been looking down. He fell on the ramp, precariously more half-off than half-on. Luckily, being right handed paid off as the microphone was in that hand and his left hand was free to try to grab on to something so he wouldn't fall completely to the floor and possibly injure himself really bad. He fell far enough forward that his left hand actually caught hold on the edge of Max's drum stand \u2013 that saved him. Remember Patti Smith's fall off the stage in 1977 when she broke her neck? Ever the consummate performer, Bruce bounced right back up and made it back to center stage to hit his cue, almost without skipping a beat. Most people in the front part of the house probably had no clue as to the fall or the averted tragedy until, as pointed out in the <em>Backstreets</em> fanzine, they saw the cut and blood on his arm on the video screen. We just looked at each other in stunned silence for a minute or two and pointed to what we had just seen. We noticed others behind the stage who had seen it were also pointing to where the fall had happened. Bruce was a Lucky Man indeed in Greensboro this night.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>G-Man</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">In '81, G-Boro was my first-ever Bruce show. My second-ever Bruce show was in G-Boro four years later, probably my all-time favorite show. And now, 17 years later, and a bunch of shows in-between, at 43 years old, I returned last night to the scene of the crime (for my first Rising Tour show, too).<br/>\nNothing Short of Amazing: What can I say except that Bruce has found a way to turn back the clock (or at least slow down Father Time). I'm stating the obvious: Great show &amp; great crowd. I think that Bruce and the band were genuinely impressed with the crowd, too. We North Carolinians know how to rock!!!<br/>\nSection 127 (side stage) was a great seat. I cannot believe how fit Bruce is. 53 years old for goodness sakes. Are you kidding me? What's his secret? Does he wear something underneath his pants to cover his knees? Those two knee slides have to hurt. I would break my knee-caps if I tried that!<br/>\nHeart-stopping moment: The fall. It was pretty nasty. I didn't realize that he had cut his arm until my friends in the pit told me after the show that he was bleeding. He did keep shaking his hand throughout the show. After the fall, I did hold my breath whenever Bruce climbed on top of the piano, when he jumped down, and when he ran around the stage. But, it didn't seem to faze him one bit.<br/>\nMost disgusting moment: This guy behind me barfed (which I didn't realize until the end of the show). I did smell something pretty nasty a couple of times (I couldn't figure out what it was). After the show, however, I'm sitting in my seat utterly exhausted when the coliseum people told me that I had to leave. I reach down for my jacket underneath my seat and it has puke all over it. It was an old jacket, so I decided to just leave it at the coliseum. Thank goodness I had my new tour T-shirt and hat in a plastic bag. That got covered, too. Why would people drink themselves into that state at a Bruce show?<br/>\nMost disbelieving moment: The guy sitting beside me to my left asked me during Mary's Place what album the song was from. I just had to shake my head and laugh.<br/>\nSet highlights: I love the Rising songs, so I loved the set. I'm glad that we got Promised Land because I love his harmonica playing. Also, Cadillac Ranch was a real treat (\"only for Greensboro\"). Suzie took over much of Clarence's sax solo at the end and then the two of them traded licks. I thought it sounded great.<br/>\nBobby Jean was an audible. I thought C's solo at the end sounded great, too (contrary to reports from the Re-Union Tour on this song). He held his notes rather well. She's the One rocked. Wow!<br/>\nMost touching moment: During Mary's Place. The part after Bruce introduces the band when he sings \"I miss you. I really miss you.\" in that high falsetto voice and he's bent over and grabbing the mike stand. For some reason, that just broke my heart.<br/>\nMost rocking moment: The new rocking Dancing is tremendous. Throw in Glory Days and BTR and what a treat for a first encore. The place went wild.<br/>\nWhat time it it? \"BOSSTIME!!\" (I'm glad that Bruce has embraced that he's The Boss!!). Ramrod was the perfect way to cap off the show. The way that Bruce holds on to the mike stand like he 's driving a car and all the false endings, leaving the stage while Roy's jamming, sneaking back on stage with flashlights, his and Steve's and C's mugging. What great SHOWMANSHIP.<br/>\nVirgin Bruce attendees' reactions: My two college friends both made it into the pit. They said that if they were going to see Bruce, they were going to go all out. They arrived at 7:30 the day of the show. Afterwards, they both said that it was well worth it. They couldn't believe how he kept on playing. They would look at each other and say, not another song?!?!?!?!!!!!!!!<br/>\nAfterwards, their first words to me was that had to be the greatest show of the tour, and then it dawned on them that he does this every night out. They couldn't believe it. They said that Bruce is such a showman. It's not just the songs but also the movements, the facial reactions, the mugging, the camaraderie between the band members. That's what really impressed them. And, of course, the energy.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>Brucefan</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Was at the show in Greensboro Sat night.

The crazy thing was that after it happened it seemed to energize him. I have seen a few other shows on this tour and he was definitely more active after this mishap. He was sliding across the stage on his knees, putting both feet up on the microphone stand and hanging backwards\u2026.etc. It was scary for a second but then turned into a great show. Tour premier of Cadillac\u2026.. a great version of Incident and Ramrod\u2026\u2026. 52 years old\u2026\u2026\u2026. unbelievable. Bruce, nobody even comes close.

We both left feeling as though we had just been through a religious experience. I am so amazed with the whole band- their stamina is incredible and everyone's personality showed through.

Not as spacious sounding underneath the overhang where we were sitting, no doubt. However, there were no sound glitches at all during the entire show except for Patti's mic not being turned up quite enough during \"World's Apart.\" No feedback at all. I also thought Max's drums and Gary's bass weren't as prominent in the mix as I would prefer.<br/>\n3rd song. What are we gonna get\" Was pleased to get \"Promised Land.\" Crowd was just\u2026 okay. Yep, this IS gonna be a tough crowd. Bruce is gonna have to really work to put this bunch over the top.<br/>\n4th song. He's doing an audible! What\" \"Night!\" Oh, my God, I've never heard him do it live! Check another off the list! I get a treat and now I'm really getting into it!<br/>\n\"Empty Sky\" and \"You're Missing.\" Sitting down now. Holding hands with Mrs. Horton. Watching Mrs. Horton wipe away tears. Folks, these were like most of you have said. Beautiful. Danny gets to cleanse us with a long organ solo to close \"You're Missing.\"<br/>\n\"Waitin\" On a Sunny Day.\" I grin at all the acoustic guitars and I know what's coming. This was fun! Did he just throw a microphone way out into the side stage side from where Patti stands for someone to sing into'!\" How is he gonna get that thing back'! With the help of an assistant, he does. But I never heard whoever ended up with the mic singing anything. Too shy\" (Does anyone with a better view than I had know') The crowd is gettin\" hotter now, and Bruce does his first knee slide of the evening. Crowd roars!<br/>\n8th song. OH\u2026 MY\u2026 GOD!!! It's \"DARLINGTON COUNTY!!\" HE'S DOING \"DARLINGTON COUNTY!!\" Now I am hitting the freakout zone. I'm having a seizure telling Mrs. Horton, Brian, and Julie what a rarity this is, a tour first, the first time he's done this on a tour post-9/11, and to listen for the World Trade Centers line to see what he does. He does me proud by not changing a fucking thing'did someone else on this board say \"up yers, Bin Laden\" It feels like\" It's okay now, people. I'm a long way from New York City, and it's time to let this one come out again, it's been long enough.\" And it also feels like, \"I know I've got a tough crowd on my hands, this isn't my turf, I'm gonna hit \"em with stuff they're more familiar with, stuff from my biggest album.\" You know what\" In that moment, I didn't mind AT ALL! Clarence and Soozie squaring off center stage! Bruce grinding out a Stones riff when the music stops, and they kick back into it again! Crowd LOVED it! NOW it feels like a special night and I'm grinning ear to ear and so glad to be there and thinking about what's going on at the Lake and \"wait \"til someone posts THIS one on the setlist thread!\"<br/>\nRight into\u2026 \"World's Apart.\" Ah! Shrewd move, Bruce! Nice the way the songs play off each other. The guy really does put some thought into how his songs work with one another. I dug it!<br/>\n\"Badlands!\" \"She's the One!\"<br/>\n\"Bobby Jean!\" Would have preferred something else, but again, I think he's hauling out lots of BITUSA for this crowd. After Clarence's last looooooooooong high note to end the song, I turned to Brian and said, \"I think that eye must be doing just fine.\" Man!<br/>\n\"Mary's Place.\" Fun, fun, fun! Mrs. Horton liked this one better than \"10th Avenue\" because the band intros were shorter. What I can remember that stood out:<br/>\n\"Silvio, Silvio, Silvio\u2026\" big roar for Steven!<br/>\n\"The man that bring the power\u2026\" same for Max!<br/>\n\"From Flemington, New Jersey, newly divorced\u2026 and ladies, he's staying at the Ramada!\u2026\" this was absolutely HILARIOUS!

I couldn't make this out. But he said something and went down on his knees and said \"Thank you, baby! Thank you, baby!\" and Mrs. Horton just cracked up. I forgot to ask Mrs. Horton what he said before that. Somebody\"<br/>\nClarence. Crowd ate this up! Yeah, we wish we could be like him, but we know we just can't! It was the WAY Bruce said it that was so funny!<br/>\nLet it rain! Let it rain! Let it rain! Let it rain! People get ready! Knee slide! Yeah!<br/>\n\"Countin' On a Miracle\" I welcomed this one! Crowd appreciated Nils great work on the intro. I know what's been said here about this one, but I dug it and thought it rocked really hard. Lord knows, Mrs. Horton and I had some special appreciation for this one and we sang our hearts out to this one.<br/>\n15th song. Okay, folks, this is when I completely went ape shit. Before I knew what was coming, I turned to Brian and said, \"Here's the unknown slot. There's no telling WHAT's coming up next.\" I had no idea.<br/>\nWhen Bruce introduced \"hometown girl\" EMMYLOU HARRIS, I mean, I went just NUTS!!!<br/>\nI know I kept yelling \"Oh my God!!!\" over and over until the song started, and then I shut my yap and just let it soak right through me. I told Mrs. Horton, \"Sweetie, I just died and went to heaven!\" This was FANTASYLAND, people! It was awesome, breathtaking, gorgeous, aching, whatever, fill in your exclamation of praise. Get the damn boot just so you can hear this!!!! A special night just got even more special! Emmylou walked over to Patti and they exchanged hugs that seemed to exhibit genuine friendship, and Bruce led the applause for Emmylou as she left the stage. Gram Parsons must have been smiling, somewhere. I know I have another memory that will last me a lifetime.<br/>\nSong #16. Patti's weirdly haunting vocal intro. Bruce begins to sing. I guess I don't have to tell you all that this was a very special moment for me and the Mrs. A circle felt complete. For us, it was a pilgrimage to hear him do this live. One hand holding on to the other's, one hand up in the air, and singing, singing, singing.<br/>\nEncores! (Party time!) Brian said, \"Hey, Courtney Cox is from Birmingham, too! You don't think she will be here for Bruce to pull up onstage'!\" I laughed and told him that the way our night's been going, I suppose anything's possible, but that that was a real longshot! BTW, the rocked-up DITD is most excellent!<br/>\n\"Glory Days\" HERE is where he finally, convincingly, cracked the crowd, and you could feel it. NO ONE sitting, EVERYONE up and dancing and into it.<br/>\n\"Born to Run\" Really. What more can be said\"<br/>\n\"Cadillac Ranch\" HOLY SHIT! 4 songs in the first encore, and another tour rarity! I'm glad someone else here noticed the Bear Bryant hat! Can this man play to a crowd or what! Oh, yes indeed, the crowd ate it up! What a fuckin\" ham! Doncha love it!<br/>\n\"My City of Ruins\" very nice. I had to stand. I had to.<br/>\n\"Land of Hope and Dreams\" I remember telling Mrs. Horton to make sure that this one got played at my funeral.<br/>\n\"Ramrod\" He can play this song at every show he does for the rest of his life and I won't mind at all. This thing has become THE SONG THAT NO LONGER MAKES ME PINE FOR ROSALITA.OR THE DETROIT MEDLEY. This thing has become THE showtopper -offer. This thing is so, so, SO much fun that he can keep on playing it even 10 minutes longer than he does and I won't mind. What time is it\" B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-BOSS TIME!!!!!!!!!!! This man is the greatest showman in rock, bar none, hands down, fuhgetaboutit.<br/>\nShow over. 2 hours and 39 minutes. I checked myself. I had the feeling. I\u2026 was\u2026 drained. But in the way that makes you feel cleansed and energized. We said our goodbyes like disciples who had just been baptized again, ready to face what the world had to give. The drive home was not a problem at all. After talking about it with Mrs. Horton for an hour, she went to sleep and I kept on driving and smiling and shaking my head. And I couldn't wait to share this with you all and to read what you all thought. If this was the Little Rock for this tour, then I am just speechless at the thought of what the rest of you have been/will be witnessing.<br/>\nOverall verdict! There is still magic in the night.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Danny</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">I was fortunate enough to stand touching the stage between Patti &amp; Steve. What a show! Darlington County absolutely rocked\u2026 I was talking to some people about that song prior to the show and we figured it would not be played since there is a WTC reference\u2026 It was played and not changed\u2026.. The whole crowd was \"sha la la -ing\"\u2026. As for My Hometown w/ Emmylout, it too was great\u2026 \"Just the ladies\" bruce said after looking around at the start of the song and seeing just Emmylou, Patti, &amp; Suzie on stage. BTUSA/Thuder road was on the setlist as was Atlantic City\u2026 I think we got \"Night\" instead of Atlantic City and I know we got Cadillac ranch in the BTUSA/TR spot\u2026. Absolutely no complaints here. Cadillac Ranch was \"by request\" from a sign holder center stage saying something to the effect of \"I breast fed in line for 6 hours to hear Cadillac Ranch\" - She had her infant in the line prior to the show obviously\u2026 Someone tossed a Houndstooth hat on stage at the beginning of Cadillac Ranch (like the one Bear Bryant - former Alabama Football Coach) used to wear\u2026 I think the reference was lost on Bruce who said \"Pinky Lee\" and started strutting around like Pinky Lee (apparenty a '60's tv character who wore this kind of hat)\u2026. Another funny moment was during the Ramrod and the \"what time is it\" portion of the song\u2026 He said \"steve, I think it is time to go back to the hotel and watch pronographic movies\" and some people at center stage tossed some porn boxes on stage. Steve and Bruce laughed and picked them up\u2026 Patti Rolled her eyes when she saw\u2026 Also, Bruce was trying to hula hoop his guitar around his neck at the end of the Eternal Ramrod song and after 3 failed attempts in a row (he had made some successful ones earlier in the song) he laughed and said \"Ah F*** it!!\u2026.. I hope eveyone down the road gets as good a show as we saw last night\u2026.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Steve Klein</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Take a sparse stage, add competent lighting, good sound. Hold the special effects, ditch the dancers. It's pure rock. The E Street Band is as tight as ever. One almost has to tear himself away from the music to even realize how GOOD these guys are individually. Then there is the Boss, doing it. Voice as powerful as ever, Bruce and the band making great music. The \"\"Rising\"\" songs live are as powerful as the lyrics. The trio, with the soaring voice of EmmyLou Harris, Bruce and Patty, reminded us that it is our hometown. It was all about the music here. Wasn't aware of my friends beside me, the parents behind me with their two primary school kids, rocking and singing together as a family until the show ended. Bruce's lyrics are too complex, the melodies too tightly woven, the band making it happen, for me to have any mental diversions. It was a good night, the music won.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I had made the trip from England as part of a hundred strong contingent from the English Badlands fan club, who were here to see all three Florida shows.<br/>\nAt approx. 2015 Bruce and the band came onstage, and with a quick \"Good evening Orlando!\" they launched into what was the best opening to a Springsteen concert I have ever seen. The Rising flowed into Lonesome Day and the band were really giving it everything, being so close I could see the effort these guys were putting in. After Lonesome Day Bruce called out \"Come on Nils, come on Max!\" and No Surrender followed. If memory serves me correct this version had an instrumental opening salvo minus the vocal harmonies used on the album and at the Meadowlands in '99. And if I thought things couldn't get much better then that a big smile came to my face as I recognized the symbol rustling opening to Candy's Room. This version was on fire and came complete with the excellent guitar screeching to close the song.<br/>\nEmpty Sky and You're Missing followed in immaculate fashion, and the somber mood was lifted with a sing-a-long Waitin' On a Sunny Day, with Bruce renaming Stevie as 'Orlando Steve'! The good mood continued with a surprising rendition of Darlington County, complete with \"World Trade Center\" lyric, and so it should to! Then came the big surprise of the night so far as Bruce started strumming the opening chords of Saint in the City. The crowd went wild and the song really rocked. However the song did not end with the traditional guitar duel. Instead Bruce gestured for Roy to bang down on the keys of the piano, to which he gratefully obliged. Obviously impressed with the results Bruce waved Roy on to close out the song in this manner.<br/>\nUp next was Worlds Apart and at last we got to see the guitar duel as one of these closes out this number before the band leap into Badlands. The house lights go up until Bruce sings \"Lights out tonight\". She's the One was next minus the drum intro you might expect, this year the song hits straight into the keyboard intro familiar to the album version, with Clarence giving it plenty of maracas. Following this we had a sing-long Mary's Place, and just where Bruce tries to quiet the song down just before the \"I've been missing you\" rap, the Orlando crowd yelled Bruuuce! so much that he gave up trying to get a quiet moment and carried on, grinning all the way. It was clear this was no ordinary night and Human Touch followed, dedicated to at least three people, and boy did this one rock, unrecognizable from the '92 version in it's power and strength. Bruce then walked over to the piano and said \"I haven't done this in a while, so I hope I can get through it!\" and performed The Promise, which I never thought I would here live.<br/>\nInto The Fire followed with a new vocal intro by Patti, who is so much improved on this tour. This song is one of the big highlights of the concert.<br/>\nThe encores were amazing, already going down in Springsteen legend. He walked out and tried to play the opening to Glory Days, but he had left on a grip type thing which holds the strings down. He quickly threw it over his shoulder and continued. At the end of this he looked at the band and shrugged his shoulders and said \"Born To Run?\", obviously making the set list up as he went along at this late stage. He then played this with full house lights on and the crowd were wild. Again, being so close I could see exactly what happened next. As the song closed out Bruce looked at Stevie and called into his ear \"Devil With The Blue Dress!\" Little Stevens face was a picture as he gazed into the crowd with disbelief and stood rigid. Bruce laughed and said \"Devil with the Blue dress!, tell Roy, tell Roy!\" By now the rest of the band were wondering what to do so Nils came over, got the word and rushed over to tell Clarence and Danny. Bruce faced Max and called out the next number, and like a cool dude he nodded and said \"ok\". With a \"1-2-3-4\" Bruce opened the song and his face was a picture as he listened out to see if the band could remember it! Through the song it featured Devil, Good Golly Miss Molly, CC Rider and Jenny take a ride only. No 'I hear a train' or 'Travellin' band'. After this one the band left the stage with every one smiling and joking about the impromptu performance.<br/>\nShortly after the band came back to do My City of Ruins, Born in the USA and Land of Hope And Dreams. But they weren't finished yet, and for the first time on the tour they used an extended Dancing in the Dark to close, which fits perfect in this position. A great concert, and fans who have been following Bruce for years hailed this as their favorite show of all time.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

What I was privileged to witness last night will not get out of my mind. I've seen Bruce 5 times and this is by the far the best he's been. Where do we start? Well I was a bit concerned because my ticket was facing the back corner of the stage. However when my friend and I arrived, we were pleasantly surprised to find were only 10! rows back. OK enough about me- on with the show. What a setlist! The Rising songs sounded great live. This concert had many surprises! When Bruce introduced Bono and Dave Stewart I almost fell over the row in front of me. Then they launched into an absolute blistering version of \"Because the Night\". I won't list all of the songs he did because you can read that in the setlist area, but I can only remark about the feelings I had in being a part of this astounding experience. The version of \"Dancing in the Dark\" absolutely rocked! I hope he releases it on a future CD. When can you say that you saw not one, but two legendary singers appear at a concert! Dion? Are you serious? He's older that Bruce and his voice still sounded great. I felt like I was listening to some old friends singing on the street corner. At the risk of sounding pretentious, I remarked to my friend that we will always remember this concert for the rest of our lives. In my 36 years of being around there has never been anyone who can perform like Bruce Springsteen. Thanks for reading.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Darren Cooksey</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">After the awesome show in Orlando it was hard to figure how he could top that, but when you travel all the way from England to catch three shows you enjoy every minute you can! This time around I was seated on the side of the arena, middle-ish, high up in the nosebleeds. As the time neared the 2015 time it was a bit worrying to see the floor two thirds empty and lots of empty seats, but as the concert began it soon filled up to a near full-house. Bruce walked on and greeted us with \"Good evenin' Miami!\" and sang 'The Rising' and 'Lonesome Day'. Next up was 'The Promised Land', a nice early slot for this number, which is great because you know that somethin' special will follow Sunny Day later on! He followed this with 'The Fuse' and 'Candy's Room' which were great but marred by poor sound in the arena. You could hear background voices over the speakers and it was a little off-putting. It was like being in a multiplex cinema watching a quiet movie and all you can hear is explosions and bullets from the screen next door. A major sound cock-up, but thankfully it didn't last too long.<br/>\nAfter the trilogy of Rising songs finished with the audience participation of 'Sunny Day', Bruce said \"This is for Doug!\" and for the first time on the tour he pulled out 'Out In The Street', identical to the Re-union tour version. A powerful run through of 'Worlds Apart, Badlands and She's The One got the place rocking, and the following 'Mary's Place got every one off their asses.<br/>\nThis tour has been full of surprises, but imagine our surprise when you consider what happen next! On came the extra microphone stand and Bruce introduced 'Dave Stewart' and some one else. I thought he said Bono, but couldn't be sure. On strolled Dave Stewart with guitar in hand, and sure enough on came Mr. U2 himself\u2026 Bono. The place erupted. Roy began the opening intro to 'Because The Night' and the roar was deafening. Bono sang the first two versus with Bruce singing another. Dave belted out the guitar salvo and the song ended with some nice improvised raps from Bono, a great version of this song. Bruce then climbed to his piano and acknowledged a sign behind the stage which read FOR YOU FOR MY BIRTHDAY! He dedicated the song to the fan at the end he wished her happy birthday, a nice touch and a green flag to anyone wishing to hear a particular song. The superb Into The Fire rounded off the first set.<br/>\nThe encores were anticipated greatly as every one expected to see Bono again, but more surprises were in store! So Young And In Love, from Tracks and a Wild and The Innocent out-take opened up, with Bruce urging everyone to scream at the appropriate point in the later stages of the song. Glory Days followed with a middle portion were Bruce explained how Miami Steve got his name. Yet another guest, Dion, came out to sing a teleprompter read 'If I Should Fall behind', same as the '99 version but with Bruce and Dion trading lines. Clarence walked over in the darkness with his Sax to try to get a solo but Bruce waved him off! A rousing Born To Run, My City Of Ruins, Born In the USA and Land Of Hope and Dreams closed out the show, but sure enough as in Orlando the rejuvenated Dancing In The Dark closed out the show. Fantastic follow up to Orlando!!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>MadamMarie</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">WOW!! I've seen Bruce and the band 13 times and Miami was the second greatest show I've seen. From the opening chords of The Rising, Bruce and the band were tight and on and remained that way all night! Candy's Room, Out in the Street, She's the One, SO YOUNG AND IN LOVE!!! Rockin! Bruce and Bono! Was I dreaming? Because the Night was just about perfect. Dion and Bruce took If I Should Fall Behind (one of my favorite songs ever, to a new level. It was just beautiful! The first timer I took (my 69 years young Mom) loved it also and was finally able to realize what her daughter was all about all these years! Bravo Bruce and fellow E Streeters. In my opinion there is no other rock and roll band today, alive or dead, that can match the musicianship of this band. Thanks Bruce!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Morten T.</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">The show was supposed to have started at 7:30\u00a0pm, but due to 'a wreck on the highway', I suppose they decided to delay it an hour, which was ok, as we knew what was coming. It was only my 2nd Bruce concert and was really looking forward to comparing it with the one we saw in Paris some 2 years ago.<br/>\nIt started out with 'The Rising' which is such a great song, and the crowd seemed to enjoy it quite a bit. After 'a Lonesome Day', we got 'treated' with 'The Promised Land' which reminded me of the live-version on the 'live 1975/1985'. Already there you knew this was going to be something special.<br/>\nBruce then knew that he had us in the palm of his hands and announced that he needed some silence during the next few songs. It's amazing that one man can make 20,000 people 'shut up' for a certain period of time. What we then were experiencing was something quite unique, as the crowd was completely quiet during 'the fuse', and it seemed like the audience lost the 'steam' a bit, but then came<br/>\n'Mary's Place' which I never really enjoyed on the cd, but live it's such a happy song, and it really got this 'house party' (as Bruce called it) started. The arena was rocking and jumping, and the party certainly started.<br/>\nAfter a mixture of new and old songs, came a huge surprise. Dave Steward and Bono were introduced and that got everybody totally wild. 'Because the night' was performed so beautifully by Bruce and bono, and it seemed like everybody were singing as loud as they could. Two great voices at the same time made this song probably one of the best of the evening. It was performed with such power and passion. By the way, it was amazing to see how 'small' bono was next to the boss.<br/>\nI can of course keep going on and on about each song performed, which I will not do, but can all in all say that this show was absolutely perfect. In the weeks before the show i was hoping for certain songs to be played, and have to say that i was not disappointed, however had hoped to have heard either 'thunder road' or 'racing in the streets', but guess we can't have everything !!<br/>\nAt the end of the show it seemed like Bruce was only getting started and fired up. He was running like crazy around the stage and sliding on his knees, which is exactly what we came to see. Have to add that everybody in the band looked great and it really appeared that they were having a great time together. The newest addition to the band, Ms. Soozie did really great, and her violin added something quite unique.<br/>\nOn the way home from the American airlines arena, we passed by about 20 homeless people fighting for Cover and blankets - quite a sad and 'scary' sight, keeping in mind that we just left the arena singing 'land of hopes and dreams'\u2026\u2026<br/>\nThanks, Bruce (and the rest of the band) for an experience which will be remembered for life.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I was never really a Bruce fan until I hooked up with my boyfriend of that time - who was from New Jersey and a diehard fan. He gave me a copy of The Rising and told me he had tickets for the show at the St. Pete Times Forum (Ice Palace). I listed to the CD until I practically wore it out! I was hooked. I could not wait for the show. The show was everything I could have asked for and more. I sang every song as loud as I could although I could not hear myself for all the other fans doing the same. Some of the songs even brought me to tears, which really seemed to impress my boyfriend. He said later that he could tell by my reaction to each song that I truly understood what the Boss and his music was all about. I have never been so emotionally moved by anything like that before and have not since. If Bruce comes back to the Tampa Bay area again, I will do whatever it takes to get tickets just to have that experience one more time.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Burt Wiseman</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">The show lasted 2 hours 45 minutes. I was in the first row off the floor, they closed with Twist and Shout and someone wants to kill Bruce Springsteen!<br/>\nTampa will be one quiet city come Monday morning. Seventy some odd thousand football fans watched the Tampa Bay Buccaneers break a curse with the Green Bay Packers in one of the most important games in the Bucs history. Bust through the stadium crowds, hop in the car and take the back streets to the Springsteen concert at the St. Petersburg Times Forum for the closing show of the Florida run of the 2002 Tour. A great football game and a Springsteen concert proves to be quite a hit on the vocal chords of any fan. Little talk will occur at the water coolers and coffee makers Monday. Maybe the occasional knowing smile and thumbs up will be all that needs to be exchanged to fill volumes of adjectives to attempt a description of the exuberance that Tampa felt on Sunday. Think Tampa, think Laryngitis.<br/>\nI was worried before the show. Even while watching the monitors at the Forum and witnessing Tampa kick cheese-heads back to whey (Green Bay is from Wisconsin, which is a state in the US famous for cheese production. Thus the fans of Green Bay are called Cheese Heads), I felt that this nights concert would not be a match for the enthusiasm felt with each Tampa Bay touchdown. How could the band compete? Heck, Saturday night in Miami, from all accounts I heard and read, it was a classic show. Guest appearances, the Detroit Medley , how can you top that? Well, maybe Bono was not in Tampa, but any higher a level of excitement at the Saint Petersburg Times Forum would have been a riot. The band, they did it again. Like they always do. There is no other band that has ever delivered better Rock and Roll than Bruce Springsteen and the E-Street Band. I actually thought that the band might be strained from the near 3 hour explosion that was offered to the fine folks in Miami. Boy am I dumb. Where the last tour was like Rock and Roll Church, this one is a pep rally for the free world. Not one separated by 8 Miles, (see Eminem if you graduated from Old School) the real free world of the planet earth. When I thought they may just go through the motions, they went through emotions. From the requested quiet during an acoustic Empty Sky and the subtle private sorrow of a softer You re Missing , to the near cataclysmic Mary s Place we were on a bipolar-coaster ride through the night. My God, Ramrod ends with a faux reluctant return; reminiscent of James Brown s cape shrouded breakaways to center stage, that led an impromptu jam and closing number of Twist And Shout! I am now convinced that Bruce Springsteen and the E-Street Band should be a controlled substance and prescribed to anyone that needs to rise up out of their own quagmire.<br/>\nSo why would anyone want to kill Bruce? According to several security personnel at the show, Bruce has had threats on his life. Before the sound check, the arena was sniffed by Canines that indicate on the scent of explosives. I met a couple that acquired backstage privileges and got their copy of BTR signed by all members except Bruce and were given a set list for this nights performance. They said that Bruce had Police and plainclothes security personal at his door due to concerns for his safety and he was unable to come out and mingle. I met a group of folks from England that had been on a package deal that gave them all amenities for catching the 3 Florida shows. They were asked to not display their several foot wide British Flag during the show. There were no American flags visible either. There was a Canadian flag at the ceiling but this after all is a place where Hockey is played, a precedent to caution. Bruce and the band did exit the arena with a Police escort, sirens wailing. Funny thing that with all the security at the concert, Bruce still paused the motorcade at the backstage ramp to shake hands with a few fans before speeding off into the night. Son of a breach. Ironic it is that the last show I saw at this arena was The Rolling Stones, No Security. Clarence of course, left separately in a limousine. His retina appeared to withstand the rigors of another show. With all the precautions, the audience was hardly aware of any increased security and the show was not affected.<br/>\nThe new songs were greeted with grand respect or exuberance depending on the feel of the tune. Featured from the latest album were the title track<br/>\nThe Rising which opened the show followed by Lonesome Day . Empty Sky and You're Missing provided an early soft side to the show but we were quickly brought to a new plateau with Waiting on a Sunny Day , the Hungry Heart of the 2k s. It brought us up several notches and featured The Boss swinging on the mic stand like Gene Kelly on a lamp post in Paris. During this tune Bruce s stage antics included proof that the knee is still good by doing the running slide. I never thought I would see that again. Worlds Apart featured Patty s vocals in a haunting distant harmony to Bruce s. On the album as well as on the show, Worlds Apart was the most unique song and most departed from the norm. Mary s Place raised the roof and was used as the song to introduce the band. A very abbreviated introduction when compared to last tours 10th Avenue Freeze Out intros. Counting On a Miracle followed with Into The Fire and My City Of Ruins appearing in the last half.<br/>\nIt has taken two tours but I have now heard all of Born To Run live. Night was a great surprise as was a thud rocking, true to form She s The One . Biggest surprise? How about New York City Serenade with Bruce solo on Piano or Hard To Be A Saint In The City ? I have read about it but was still very pleased to hear it. From Darkness was Darkness On The Edge Of Town and Badlands . For the pop lovers, Born In The USA had several picks including the title song which Bruce called a song for peace , Dancing In The Dark and approaching one of three encores, Glory Days. So the band takes a bow after Land Of Hope And Dreams and Ramrod which features some play with words between Bruce and Miami Steve. What time is it Steve? Well, Tony Soprano ain't here so it must be Bosstime! Steve replies, leading a deafening reaction from the crowd. So they all took the bow and left the stage. All but The Professor, Roy Bittan. He remained playing the basic R&amp;B progression known as the boogie-woogie. Just when you thought that was it, he kicks it up a notch letting us know that it ain't over. The band has mounted the stage in the dark, Bruce pierces the darkness of the unlit stage with haunted lighting from below his face. The band goes back into Ramrod, ends it and then Bruce and the Band attempt to leave. They huddled he played an overacted attempt at departure, turned quick and came back for Twist And Shout. It was mayhem. It was exhilarating. It was freedom. It is now a ringing in my ear, a lifting of my soul and laryngitis. Go Bucs!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Darren O'Dell</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Well, I rolled out from my house in Tallahassee and made my way to see my good friend Ben in Ft. Lauderdale on the Friday before the show Sunday in Tampa. We stayed up all night listening to Bruce and others while talking over old shows attended. I rolled over to Tampa on Sunday morning taking the Alligator Alley Expressway where recently the young men were pulled over for expected terrorist activities. I pulled into downtown Tampa around 6:00 and hurried to the Arena. I had a seat about fifteen rows up on the Big Man's side. Many fans came pouring in about 8:15 from the Bucs game. Out came the band and Mr. S. ready to rock. The Rising was spirited and I was overtaken by the crowds knowledge and appreciation for the tune. Things cruised until Night knocked me off of my feet and then promptly up on my toes! I loved Waiting on. and Worlds apart and then a double blast of Greetings\u2026 YEHAAA Does and Saint man child hitting with a double shot. The highlight for me personally was Bruce introducing BITUSA as a prayer for PEACE and laying it down with all the power and conviction I had grown up imagining that song would have live.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Dee</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">The man keeps on getting better. I've seen him many times over the years and he never disappoints. Still plays a long time (2 hours 50 minutes). I wondered how some of the new songs would be live, but was pleasantly surprised at how well they were. Stunning vocals between Bruce and Patti during \"World's Apart), my least favorite song on the new album. The band was introduced during \"Mary's Place\", which really got the crowd moving. Was very pleasantly surprised with \"Night\" and \"Darkness on the Edge of Town\". As usual, \"Badlands\" was very energetic, but the arena rocked during \"Born to Run\". Maybe even the city rocked. I've never seen it so boisterous. The encores, including \"Born in the USA, Glory Days\" were great, and \"Ramrod\" was a great surprise. Except for a few slow songs, we were all on our feet singing and dancing. My voice still hasn't returned fully yet. Now my husband (who'd never seen him live before) understands why I've been such a big fan for so many years.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

While people who hadn't seen other shows on the tour did not leave disappointed, the feeling among multi-show goers was that the set was a bit unimaginative outside the new stuff (save Ties, No Surrender, &amp; Where The Bands Are). It was a 22 song set but it just didn't seem as creative or inspired as some of the other shows. And quite frankly, Bruce didn't see to connect with the (pretty appreciative) crowd either. He almost seemed angry or under the weather when he took the stage and kind of seemed like he was phoning it in throughout. Also, on a personal note, too many top-40ish Born In The USA tunes. Between Glory, USA, No Surrender (which rocked hard), and Dancing the set seemed like it could have used some more variety in the old stuff (something else off River or Wild/Innocent perhaps). Also, Dancing In The Dark isn't nearly as good a closer as Ramrod (or even Working on The Highway. Again, a great show by most standards but Bruce has us trained to hold him to higher ones.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

His voice was THE BEST I've ever heard at one of his concerts. He may be older, but time has been very gracious to him. The entire East Street Band played awesomely, from the BIG MAN, to Lil' Stevie, to Max, to the new violinist! Talk about 'Magic in the Night', from the first note of song one 'The Rising', to the finale, 'Santa Clause is Coming to Town', it was one of those nights that you wish you could just 'freeze frame' and savor for a long, long time.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

When you love songs out of his whole catalogue, you're not going to be disappointed in any show, but it was good to hear him play some things from the seventies way back (Night, Thunder Road with the band) that varied from the other show. He appeared to be enjoying Santa Claus this night (and we certainly were too), repeating the last two thirds of the song and working at spinning the tassel of the obligatory Santa hat around his head as he played. I have a rant though, and it's not directed at Bruce or the band. It would be nice if radio stations and newspapers would send reviewers to shows that pay freaking attention and know what they're talking about. To the announcer who lost his voice just after embarrassing himself on Q107 from the post show, that was \"Candy's Room\" - they did NOT play \"Prove It All Night\". To James McCarten of Canadian Press, it's \"No Surrender\", not \"Never Surrender\", and that was \"Cadillac Ranch\", not \"Pink Cadillac\".

The song selection was disappointing (a piano-only version of \"If I Should Fall Behind\", \"Land Of Hopes &amp; Dreams\"???), where were the soul wrenching songs that rock straight out of his gut? \"Cadillac Ranch\" was performed in a lower key, I guess to accommodate his fading vocal range. \"Into The Fire\" was sung with too much twang and fell into C&amp;W territory. \"Born In The USA\" was returned to its original arrangement but the vocal delivery seemed lacking any edge as if Bruce seems tired by his own songs that he has to re-invent them every tour. Where have his intro/storytelling talents gone? The sound is too murky with FOUR! guitarists competing for the riffing. Clarence is underused and Danny's keyboards were inaudible (was he plugged in?) The first time I saw Bruce in the summer of 1984, he was literally a man on fire possessed by the music\u2026 I miss that man.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Lennie</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Yowza Yowza what a show!!!

I just sat back and listened for a bit and could hear everyone word Bruce was saying. Candy's Room really rocked. First time I ever heard that song live as well as She's the One and Night (awesome)!!! Empty Sky and Missing were touching but for me the high point of the show were If I should Fall Behind (solo piano) followed by Thunder Road.

(Especially from those of us from up North who have moved down to the Carolinas.) Soozie fits right in with the E Street Band. Her violin sounded beautiful on the new slow songs from The Rising and it also worked well on Darlington County. This song got the crowd going and the band also seemed to enjoy themselves playing it. Night Rocked! Candy's room also rocked but the sound was not good. Counting on a miracle worked well in concert with Max rocking on it. Although Backstreets was a nice surprise the bass was distorted, at least on the 2nd level seats. The acoustics are not good there to begin with and any distortions only magnify the problem. Both Badlands and Born To Run were loud and tight. I really enjoyed them both. The last song of the night was Santa Claus is coming to town - extended! A lot of fun!

Some of the show highlights were a sizzling Darlington County with a guitar and violin duel between Bruce and Tyrell. Ramrod was simply out of control with the band being led off stage by Bruce while Roy banged away a Jeery-Lee, boogie-woogie beat until Bruce and band returned \u2014 simply awesome! She' s the One and Backstreets whipped the crowd into a frenzy. And the new material just keeps sounding better and couldn't be more timely. The songs from The Rising \u2014 the entire show \u2014 is so life-affirming and passionate that it seems hard to believe Bruce is in his 50s and Clarence 60. Springsteen and the Est Band rock harder than any band half their age! And with the possibility of war looming, Born in the USA couldn't be more timely. Springsteen and the band have that magical way about them that can transform a rock concert into an intimate, moving and soulful experience. The magic and passion is still there as if they were a new band flexing its muscles and eager to simply be playing for their fans. If you've missed this tour, do yourself a favor and catch their summer return. There is no better band, no musician more passionate, more committed to playing his music and resurrecting the spirit of his audience, than Bruce Springsteen and the Est Band.

My wife decided to get my son and I tickets to see Bruce on our birthday, we both have a Dec. 8th birthday, she got the tickets for us in October. We live in Northwest NJ, about a half hour from the meadowlands arena, so my wife and I have been to numerous Bruce shows. This one we thought we would share with our son who was turning 9. We couldn't believe we actually got lower level seats, being from Jersey this doesn't happen often. So along comes the weekend of Dec. 8th and Charlotte is hit with one of the biggest storms in recent history. To make things even more fun, we are leaving early Sunday morning for the Sunday night show (we own a restaurant and have to be there on Sat. night\u2026) so we decide come hell or high water we will try to make it to the show, after many calls just to make sure the show hasn't been cancelled, we are assured it isn't. OK, call the hotel, make sure we have a room for Sunday night after the show\u2026 hmmm they say \"risky\"\u2026 hell with it, we go anyway. After a nine hour straight shot we pull into what looks like a war zone\u2026 we really felt for the people of NC. We called our hotel, and sure enough, no power. now its about 5:00 with the show starting at 7:30 and we have no idea where we are. So we make it to a hotel which seems to be open, get on line, put our name on a list and hope for the best. An hour later we are told we have a room, we unload our car and get directions to the coliseum. This is when the story gets incredible. We make our way into the arena, find our seats, grab a quick bite, and just hang\u2026thanking God we made it safe and on time. While sitting in our seats, which were second level on the Clarence side of the stage, we realize we can actually walk down to where the back-stage area is\u2026 another no-no in NJ. So I bring my son down and show point out all of the guitars and all of the boards and fun stuff that makes up a concert. While we're standing there, Nils walks by..so I tell my son\u2026 now he's starting to get excited. So we sit down in what seemed to be empty seats in the first row on the side of the stage. Right before the show is about to start, Little Stevens guitar techie walks over and chats with my son, then hands him a Little Steven guitar pick. No sooner does he leave and a guy comes over and hands him a pair of Max's drumsticks. Now my wife and I just can't believe this. With all of the shows we have been to this is just unheard of, wouldn't even dream this stuff. So it ends up the seats are empty, so we can stay. I cant tell you the feeling of sitting that close to this band that we have only been able to admire from quite a distance, how human it made the whole experience. Then the show\u2026. something I cant put into word, the experience was just incredible\u2026. But get this\u2026 the topper on the whole night, when Bruce went into his final encore, and does his trip around the stage to kind of say good night, my wife catches his attention.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

As the encores came, Bruce and band launched into a terrific version of the Detroit Medley immediately after Born to Run \u2014 reminded me of the River Tour \u2014 same energy and party-time feel.

I was really sorry I didn't him in Boston (I couldn't even scalp them with $250 in my pocket!), figuring that the quality of show that he'd do in a smaller city like Albany wouldn't match that which he'd do in Boston. Boy was I happy I went to NY! Not only did I get to see him sing \"Santa Claus\" (which I narrowly missed out on way back in 1981), but when he ripped into \"Around and Around\" it capped a great night. It's wonderful to see a seasoned artist like Bruce pull some old song out of the hat, especially when it seemed the band was as surprised as everyone else (at one point, Bruce shouted out that the band was \"winging it\", and later shouted out to the band \"E!\" when it became apparent that not everyone was playing in the same chord.

Well, if five days could make a difference, imagine what four months could do. Last night s show in Albany ranks in my top five of performances I have seen. There were so many highlights; I hope I don t leave anything out.<br/>\nAfter what seemed like a bit of a sluggish start with The Rising and Lonesome Day, the band nailed The Ties That Bind, which features one of Clarence s best solos. My Love Will Not Let You Down followed, which is great for the way that Bruce will first jam with Steve, then Nils, and then all three will finish the song with screaming guitars. This then brought us to Night, which I hadn't seen performed since Hartford in 1980, when he opened the show with it at my first concert of his. The crowd really got into this song, and the place was energized. You could tell early on that Bruce was feeling pretty loose and that we were going to be in for a great show. After the always emotional Empty Sky and You re Missing, he throws us a curveball. Fully expecting to hear Waiting On A Sunny Day, I was surprised to see him grab the electric instead of acoustic guitar. What followed was one of the better versions of Darkness On The Edge of Town I've ever heard. Maybe due to the two songs that preceded it, but I don t think he s ever sang it with so much raw emotion and anguish in it. Whether it was part of his thought process or not, it was ironic to follow up Darkness with Sunny Day. He always seems to have a lot of fun with this song. At one point, he was holding the mic out to several kids at the end of the stage by Patti. Not sure whether they were his kids, or maybe his sister s. If you didn't think he was loose yet, the twenty foot knee slide he did after running the full length of the stage would have confirmed it for you there. The crowd went nuts for that.<br/>\nFor me, She s The One was the highlight of the night. This was another song that for me was a rarity to see live. I m not sure if he has done this at previous shows on this tour, but at the end he started wailing on the harmonica and got into a duel with Clarence on sax which reminded me of when he and Steve would trade off guitar licks at the end of Saint In The City. The crowd just exploded at the end of this. Another new twist that he has added is the acoustic solo for Nils leading into Counting On a Miracle. It accomplishes two things. It gives everyone a chance to catch their breath after Mary s Place and gives Nils a little showcase for his talents.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">George</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">This was my fifth Springsteen show and had high expectations for my first Rising show. Throughout the tour I found the setlists interesting but felt that it lacked a certain punch of the reunion shows. Bruce and the Band's first five song (rising, lonesome, ties, my love will not let you down, and night) was probably the best Springsteen moment I have ever had and it was great. It gave me a certain respect that for this tour and now I believe it is debatable which tour is better.<br/>\nI heard a great deal about Patti's improvement on this tour but I simply do not buy it after hearing her solos. Her \"contributions\" were dastardly. She destroyed Empty Sky and Into the Fire with her solos. I had head that she added a great deal to empty sky but was disappointed greatly. I also heard that the crowd cheers the line \"I want an eye for an eye\" but was surprised that it was so loud. Bruce was clearly annoyed and next time around added a yeah to fill the gap. Your Missing was beautiful and Darkness in that spot is perfect in every possible way. Best version I have ever heard.<br/>\nBruce nailed Waiting on a Sunny Day and No Surrender. I was looking forward to Worlds Apart but it simply failed to be as good as the album version (same with Counting).<br/>\nBadlands, She's the One, where awesome and The dual at the end between the sax and harmonica wasn't much of a dual. Couldn't really hear the harmonica as much as I would have liked but it was till pretty cool.<br/>\nI thought Mary's Place would disappoint live. the \"turn it up\" line is crucial and a culmination of that first half of the show and it is awesome. having heard 10th avenue so many times in this spot and was anxious for something new and it did not disappoint, This hard land into the fire and counting were all kinda weak even though they were nice to hear. Nil's solo was cool. Dancing was awesome, Ramrod was a crowd pleaser even though I couldn't get into it. Born to Run was great as always.<br/>\nMCOR was awesome and beautiful and really perfect. Born in the USA kind of blew but LOHAD of hope and dreams was a highlight for me. Santa was a good time and around and around was awesome because I thought for sure Santa would be it.<br/>\nOverall the second best show I have been too and from the rising to Mary's Place it was a perfect set.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Ashley Ward</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">I travelled from the UK for this one and even my lack of geographical knowledge that Albany was still quite a distance from NYC was worth it. I am not sure how much of the enjoyment was derived from being so far from home with Bruce in his own country and how much was down to the quality of the show. It was excellent. On this tour I had previously seen him at Wembley and the following Summer I would see him 3 times on almost consecutive nights outdoors in the UK but personally nothing matched this one. I agree totally with the other reviews and would only add that Santa Claus was a delight to behold - complete with festive named hats.

First time was before The River came out, then at No Nukes (I grew up in New York), then at Richfield Coliseum in Cleveland after Born in the USA. Bruce and the band are just amazing. They're older, but they sure don't act any different. The show was very familiar; like going home. The pace of the show seemed different with more breaks in the momentum for slow songs and frankly, they're not all my cup of tea. But the band is better than ever, there were songs to please everybody and it's only right for Bruce and the band to want to put some of the old tunes (my favorites) to rest and show the world what they can do now. It would be fun to hear them play the E Street Shuffle though!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>Bass Man</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">This was a great Bruce Springsteen show. He came out with good enthusiasm. (though someone I talked to said in Cleveland he had more) he opened with the usual \"Rising\" and \"Lonesome Day\" combo, which works well. the highlights of the show were the performances of \"Waitin' on a Sunny Day\", \"Candy's Room,\" the newer rock version of \"Dancing in the Dark.,\" (he's onto something great with this) and \"Glory Days.\" Everyone in the place was dancing. in the middle of \"Glory Days\" he broke into \"Hang on Sloopy.\" it was one of the best medleys I've ever heard. \"Santa Claus is coming to town\" was working for everyone too. \"Dancing in the Dark\" was a good way to end the show and it had the audience wanting more. (which is never a bad thing). The show was great. It really carried on and I never thought that it was dragging. \"If I Should Fall Behind\" was done solo on the piano and I think that's one of the best versions I've heard. All in all, the audience was happy and i think the band was satisfied with this one as well.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Jeff Mazurek</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Anyway, impressions as I remember them from the nosebleeds \u2014 furthest section away, almost as far up as you can be.<br/>\nCompared to Auburn Hills: better show, worse crowd. Well, maybe just the section I was in \u2014 it got up for about 6 songs, the rest of the time we were sitting down. Which is really too bad.<br/>\nThe Rising / Lonesome Day / Promised Land / The Fuse<br/>\nOk, I'm lumping these four together because I can. The whole string reminded me of how keyboard based the E St Band really is. Bruce hit better guitar solos than at the last show \u2014 crisper notes, less duds, all good considering he plays solos with his eyes closed. Hearing the piano-guitar-sax-harmonica combo in the bridge of Promised Land reminded me of why I ever liked the song. Its magical to hear it. Somehow I keep on avoiding the song on record and on live recordings, but just love to see it played.<br/>\nCandy's Room<br/>\nThis one gets to be by itself. I said, \"Holy shit! Candy's Room? YEAH!\" \u2026 it was one of the unexpected ones for the night. A real ripper for guitar work, and its just \u2026 weird, how short the song really is.<br/>\nEmpty Sky / You're Missing<br/>\nThis again put a spell over the crowd. Bruce asked for quiet, and he got it \u2014 falsetto vocals, acoustic guitar, piano work \u2014 the subtle pieces seemed to work the best out of everything. Didn't get people moving away like \"The Fuse\" did.<br/>\nWaitin' on a Sunny Day / Out in the Street<br/>\nPutting these together because they both managed to get everyone singing, both songs are immense fun to listen to. And plus \u2014 and I kid you not \u2014 Bruce took a running start and slid on his knees across the front of the stage. 15, 20 feet. Dan and I thought he was going to slide right off the edge. I still can't understand how he did that, though it did look like he got a drink of water / greased his knees before he did it.<br/>\nWorlds Apart / Badlands / Two Hearts<br/>\nThe crowd remains seated. Worlds Apart again shows off some mean mean guitar work from Bruce and Steve van Zandt, notes sounding like human screams. Somehow. Badlands is still a warhorse of a song, and got at least some of our section standing. Two Hearts is never a song that I can say I liked much. Nuff said there. I missed \"She's the One\" in this spot, and can only wonder if out section would have stood for the Bo Diddley beat.<br/>\nMary's Place<br/>\nFinally, people in our lame section stood up. But only because Bruce pretty much made them. He said something like, \"Are you ready? Its time to get off your asses! Over there too! Yes, come on up for the ass rising!\" And another 15-20 feet knee slide across the stage at the end of the song. Wow. This song also introduced the band. Clarence (the sax player) was introduced as, among other things, \"Emperor of Ohio and all adjacent territories!\" In Auburn Hills he was introduced simply as \"The coolest man on the whole goddam planet!\" The song also included a small snippet of \"Rescue Me,\" when he introduced Patti.<br/>\nCountin' on a Miracle / If I should Fall Behind<br/>\nThe former featured an extended acoustic guitar intro from Nils Lofgren, probably the best guitar work of the entire show, such subtle touch Nils has. The song still is kind of weird to listen to. The latter featured Bruce playing solo on the piano. He's a fine piano player. Did some pretty good vocal work on the piece too, and I wondered what it sounded like when he and Dion did it earlier on the tour.<br/>\nThunder Road<br/>\nThis one stands alone. Always has, always will. I believe it to be the best song that Bruce ever wrote, and the way he plays it now \u2014 just slow enough for a romantic sort of dance, but still with the full band, and less manic vocals, it works better than ever. Poetry.<br/>\nInto the Fire<br/>\nI like it better live than on album, but the way Bruce approached the song in general it just seems so blatant that I didn't care for it much. My brother's wife, a firefighter, loved it.<br/>\nWhere the Bands Are<br/>\nFirst of the encores. Nobody knew it except us die hards who actually shucked out a bunch of money for the \"Tracks\" boxed set, or those who actually bought that CD \"18 Tracks\" \u2014 its a great, upbeat song, but I was beginning to think that Bruce was pulling stuff out to try to move the crowd more. Or our section, anyway. Rest of the crowd seemed fantastic. Very high energy stuff.<br/>\nGlory Days / Hang on Sloopy / Glory Days / Hang on Sloopy<br/>\nThe double coda of this song was great to hear, and this was the second time that everyone stood up. It was a big hit. Hang on Sloopy was a bigger hit, for the McCoys some ages ago. Bruce had fun playing it. The crowd absolutely loved it. In between the \"yeahs\" the crowd was shouting the letters \"O-H-I-O\" \u2026 gee, I wonder if it was something they do at ballgames. When people of the future talk about this show, this will be the part that's most mentioned.<br/>\nBorn to Run<br/>\nThis is the one that Bruce I guess feels he can't do without \u2014 more or less played at every single concert since god knows when. In his words, it is \"summational\". House lights came on here, crowd goes nuts, does a bunch of \"wa-ohs\" \u2014 you know the story.<br/>\nMy City of Ruins / Born in the USA / Land of Hope and Dreams<br/>\nMore standing up from the crowd \u2014 particularly for the latter. Perhaps the most political part of the show was here, and Born in the USA introduced bass to the sound system that hadn't been there before. Bruce doesn't sing the chorus much really, prefers to avoid singing it. I wonder what tour he stopped doing the chorus \u2014 acoustic versions aside? He just goes ballistic on the guitar. It was like a contest between Bruce and Max to see who would let up making noise first.<br/>\nOk \u2026 a break here. About 9 or 10 Santa Claus hats got tossed on the stage from the audience, you know, as the band was waving at everybody. Bruce picks up one of the hats. He stares at it for like 2 minutes. Then \u2026<br/>\nSanta Claus is Comin to Town / Dancing in the Dark<br/>\nPlace pretty much blows up. I guess you could say that he couldn't escape the Santa hats even if he did want to go home. Bruce has the hat drooped over one eye, Clarence gets to sing the bass bits while Bruce whips his head around to make the white ball on the end of the cap swirl around like a spinning chain. And then, while its a bit cheesy to end the night with what everyone knows is your biggest hit ever, he does it anyway. I like the version on this tour though \u2014 synths replaced by organ and guitars, and Bruce pretty much jumps up and down like he's on a pogo stick through most of the song. And reprises it a couple three times. But to see \"Santa\" live, well, its like a once in a lifetime thing, and it brings the whole season to the front of your mind. My friend Dan said after this one, \"My mom is gonna be so pissed that he played that and she wasn't here.\"<br/>\nThen it was time to go home. Long boring ride, then I wolfed down a quick breakfast at Theo's \u2014 because I was starving. And back at home, in mid-Michigan, I wondered if I would go to another Columbus show should there be another. Hell, the parking was free and that really surprised me.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Without question the BEST. Actually it ranks up there with the South Bend show of 1978. One reason for Bruce's loyal following is his ability to exceed the seemingly impossible expectations by his fans. You leave the arena shaking your head and muttering, How does he do it? I don't know of another artist that moves so easily between generations. Look at the families in the audience. Going to a rock and roll show, ok any show, with my parents was unimaginable. Being a Viet Nam vet and standing next to my son during Born in the USA was a very poignant moment, I'm sure for him as well. Certainly these shows are more than an evening's entertainment. It's not Only Rock and Roll.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Jason May</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Bruce and the band conclude 2002 with their return to their rightful place atop the world of Rock and Roll. We knew he never left but others might have needed convincing. The power of the E Street Band takes the emotions of 9/11, used as the smoldering core of \"the Rising songs\" and supercharges them into the lasting memory of everyone who attended at Conseco Fieldhouse. There was definitely magic in the night\u2026 A less than full house (show was never sold out, but there obviously were many who could not juggle schedules for the Tuesday night rescheduled show) appreciated the brilliance of the E Street Band and marveled at the incomparable energy, passion and talent of the Boss.<br/>\nThe Rising and Lonesome Day led off the night solidly and laid the foundation for the ride of the night. No Surrender and Night ignited the die-hards and probably confused the 1984 Born in the USA crowd.<br/>\nNo one could miss the power and poignancy of Empty Sky and You're Missing even those who have not used \"The Rising\" as the soundtrack of ours lives in 2002. Patti and Nils and Suzie shine. Waiting' on a Sunny Day was met with enthusiasm but seemed to be missing a little 'umph'. It, the umph showed up next with Darlington County getting the crowd rolling again.<br/>\nWorlds Apart with Nils (the most underrated guitarist, this side of well. Bruce). Badlands had many of the ladies around us going nuts\u2026 which struck me as odd. Indiana loves this song, just like in 99. Steve and Bruce used Two Hearts planted the final hook into the crowd, especially when they flubbed some lines and got to goofing around. There was no going back for the Hoosiers after that, especially with the tour premiere of Loose Ends, obviously chosen since this show was a tying of up of loose ends. I've always liked this song and especially now since I have heard it live.<br/>\nMary's Place vs 10th Avenue evangelization just doesn't do it for me for the band intros. I m partial to the 10th avenue Gospel Sermon. Long Bruuuuuuccccceeee after he introduces the Big Man. Everyone finally gets off their ass with a little coaxing from the Boss. Countin' on a Miracle was excellent but might have been used a breather before the Big Finish. Thunder Road and Into the Fire were outstanding and I would have left happy at that point. Glory Days and Born to Run kick the night into overdrive and sets up the crowd for the Detroit Medley. You can sense some of the 1st timers think that will do it but we always know the best is meant to come.<br/>\nBruce on piano for my City of Ruins (I think I m correct, 2nd year anniversary of first performance in Asbury Park.) (Bruce thanks us for joining him and the crew down at the Shore) and asked everyone to remember the local food bank here in Indianapolis. Sadly, they were not out as strong after the show as they should have been to get the donations. I had to send an on-line donation after the fact to honor the Boss. Beautiful song that the version on The Rising just doesn't quite capture for some reason. Born in the USA is played as a prayer for peace. Sadly, many of the crowd of Reagan-ites still don t get it . Very powerful performance though.<br/>\nLand of Hope and Dreams gets a strong reception (especially versus last time in Indy) and is just a great song that gets better and better every time I hear it. House lights are up and still no Santa. The GA crowd was well organized and prepared with 100s of Santa hats. The mountain of Santa hats that lands on the stages coaxes an arrival of Santa Claus. The band and Bruce seemed to really enjoy it. Patti wears a blue Colts Santa hat, not sure the Jersey folks will like that with the NY Giants coming to Indianapolis this weekend. The night concludes with Dancing in the Dark and a Courtney Cox imitator that Steven picks out of the crowd. Bruce really seemed to enjoy the audience during the encores; the crowd redeems itself a bit from a slow start.<br/>\nThis was my 2nd B and ESB show (both @ Conseco in Indianapolis) I can t wait 3 years again. Hoping for a show in Cincinnati, Louisville or close drive again in 2003.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

The lights went down, the band came up steps from the rear onto the middle of the stage, two by two, with Bruce, of course, being last. He walked up to the microphone and said, \"I'd like to thank absolutely fuuucking nooobody\". And, bang, into a really hard rock, \"No Surrender\". I believe he had opened the previous 46 shows with the Rising. The comment, and \"No Surrender\", almost certainly had to be a reference to the Grammy awards that were five night earlier. He had won some minor awards, but the biggee, Record of the Year, had gone to Norah Jones and not the Rising. It was the sort of comment one could see him making to a table of friends at a post Grammy's party, but probably not to 12,000 at his next concert. That the comment received no mention in the press, at least that I saw, is, for me, a comment on Bruce's stature. He can do pretty much whatever he wants. Why, heck, I bet he could even get away with openly opposing the invasion and occupation of Iraq.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>Unknown</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Awesome, fantastic, energized, terrific, classic, wonderful\u2026 pick your adjective! From the moment Bruce came onstage kicking ass, with his mouth and then his music, I knew we were in for a treat. I am glad the GA pit worked out for all (show a little faith\u2026there's magic in the night) and all who I saw were having a fantastic time! The band was tight, the setlist tweaked and just the right mix of new and old. They were having FUN! We were having fun! My 7 year old did point out to me that Bruce said the \"F\" word, nothing gets past my kid! But my son had a blast, but did take a \"nap\" halfway through the show\u2026 hey, he's only 7! Kids can sleep through anything, as Nick proved tonight! I saw very few people in the seats (the close seats, anyway) sitting on their butts which was a BIG improvement over Phillips! I think with the show in the 'burbs, you lose allot of the city people who show up just to say they were there. Looking forward to hearing others opinions. I'm too wired to sleep! Bruce, thanks!

Bruce opened by coming to the mic and saying \"I'd like to thank absolutely fucking nobody\" and kicked off with No Surrender. It looked tongue in cheek to me. Then it was back to the standard structure, Rising, Lonesome day, etc. There were some sound problems, I thought \u2014 don't know if it was due to the new arena, or what, but not as good as on the other show I've been at on this tour. The band was tight, though, and it seemed like there was more of an effort to showcase the individuals than on some of the other shows \u2014 Nils with an extended acoustic intro to Counting on a Miracle, Max on BITUSA, etc., although Roy never really got the spotlight this time out. Great energy from the band, and the crowd really seemed into it. We were on the floor, and when I looked around, it seemed like most of the people in seats were up. At one point, (I think in Mary's place, I can't remember for sure) Bruce said something about getting people off their asses, which may have helped. Out In the Street was similar to the Reunion Tour, with the crowd sing along (Oh Oh!) and multiple endings. Nice to have it back in the set, it's one of my favorites. If I Should Fall Behind, another favorite, was just Bruce at the piano, and was an audible not on the original set list (someone in the pit got one, I saw it after the show). Some idiot got up on stage during Born To Run \u2014 ran up from the left side and made it down the ramp behind Nils before he got grabbed and hauled off. I can't believe that security was so lax that someone could do that \u2014 I'm sure the arena managers are embarrassed. Couldn't tell if he was trying to make a point, or was just stupid, but the band never missed a beat, and Bruce said \"he's too old to be doing that\" and kept playing. After LOHAD, the band lined up like they were going to leave, and the crowd was roaring. They stood there shaking their heads like they didn't want to do another song, then relented and played Dancing in the Dark. (Planned, I'm sure, since it was on the set list.) Bruce really looked like he was having fun on it \u2014 he kept going long enough that Clarence came out for the close with the sax, then had to retreat because Bruce kept doing the crowd repeat thing for a while. All in all a very strong show, although not as long as some. Good selection of songs, band as tight as ever, enthusiastic crowd. Hope the GA thing gets clarified at some point, I think the first 300 people there eventually made it into the pit, although in lottery fashion. Those of us that stuck around all day ended up at the front of the floor, but the communication between arena or Bruce management wasn't very good.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>Bogiesmom</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">This is my fifth show this tour &amp; it was definitely the best! Bruce &amp; the band all seemed to be in a great mood, the venue was fantastic - small compared to the rest of the places I've seen them this tour, the set list was great (of course, there were many more songs I wish they had played - like She's The One). Clarence seemed to be featured a lot more this time, which is always a treat. The audience was pumped! Much, much better than Phillips - I agree that the crowd there (at least where I was sitting) was a bunch of duds - I couldn't believe it when someone behind us asked us to sit down!! But last night the place was rocking and Bruce did not seem to want to stop playing - like in Tampa!

I was lucky enough to go to three of the four shows in Florida and for some reason (maybe for all us northeasterners down here already or for the ones that traveled down for the shows) each show i went to had a new tour premiere or a guest singer. I've been waiting to here Better Days with the E Street Band for 11 years and they didn't disappoint. GA seating for the pit and the rest of the floor was run rather smoothly except for the mad rush to the side entrance door.

In terms of the set list, it's not quite the feast we all gorged on during the Reunion Tour. Instead there's a re-energized Bruce and The E Street Band working a great new album - and that's worth the price of admission alone. This was Bruce in peak power - asking a audience for quiet during the slower numbers yet nearly inciting a riot during the rave-ups. Older Brucesters will find the non-\"Rising\" selections inspired - on this night we were treated to a solo piano \"For You\" as well as a full band \"She's The One\". The former was particularly moving as Bruce, the audience found out, has a soft spot for Richmond. Seems the city was one of the few places where Steel Mill - an early Bruce band - actually had a audience. During the encores, Bruce proved that point by bringing out Bruce Hornsby and fellow Steel Mill member Robbin Thompson to join him on the old Hank Ballard number \"Let's Go, Let's Go, Let's Go\". By the time Bruce and the band rolled into the last number of the night - \"Dancing In The Dark\" - there wasn't an ass in their seat unmoved in one way, shape or form. \"The Rising\" indeed.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

My girlfriend and I actually arrived the day before to stake out a spot in the pit. After several Springsteen shows with seats, it was our first time on the floor so we figured we'd go for broke and see if we could get up front. We ended up in the middle of the pit for one of the all time great Springsteen concerts. No doubt that it was in part due to the unique setting of boardwalk hall but that incredible set list had alot to do with it as well. \"Jersey Girl\", \"Does This Bus Stop\u2026.?\", \"Hard to Be a Saint\", \"Glory Days\", \"Roll of the Dice\", and a great cover of the Beatles' \"Tell Me Why\" as Springsteen said \"it was old school that night and the band seemed to be loving it\". The \"Miss America\" theme song led the band on stage and Little Steven strutted up as if he were on the cat walk in front of the judges. The entire band looked extremely excited to be doing their first show in Atlantic City. You couldn't ask for a better beginning with \"Atlantic City\" to start. So much energy in the crowd and on stage. One of the many highlights for me was the \"Jersey Girl\" solo on the piano by Bruce. The entire crowd joined along and Springsteen had a wide smile on his face as we all sang that line about \"Dropping your brat off at your Mom's\". I had been saying all week that in addition to \"Atlantic City\", \"Roll of the Dice\" would be perfect with the band, and to the best of my knowledge Bruce had never done it live with The E Street Band before. When Bruce said \"This is for all you high rollers out there\" right away I was the idiot jumping up and down in the pit. I guess I just love that song. Prior to that \"Dancing in the Dark\" featured a \"Little Courtney Cox Wannabe\", the little girl, maybe 4 or 5 came up on stage and danced around with the Boss. He gave her a high five after wards and you knew her parents must have been on the high of a lifetime. The whole experience was incredible. From waiting on the freezing cold boardwalk for the pit check in times Thursday night and Friday to the confused line up procedure as we entered the arena Friday night. Even the quirks seemed to make it special. So many Bruce fans lined up on the boards talking Bruce, singing Bruce, it was so awesome. I can remember Friday in the early afternoon, in the hall, as we lined up for pit position, a girl, she must have be 3 years old singing the words to \"Mary's Place\". She seemed to know the song by heart, Good Parenting!!! It can't be said enough, What a great night. We stayed the weekend in A,C., gathering up newspapers highlighting the E Street Band. There was something special down the shore that night!!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Tom Cantillon</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Very impressive and full of surprises! Although not fully unexpected, Bruce did open with a very powerful rendition of Atlantic City and passionate The Rising. One of the many highlights was actually when Springsteen took a moment to discuss the line \"I want an eye for an eye\" from Empty Sky. He stated that it was in no way a call for revenge or war-like violence because the world is already plagued with enough violence and too little peace. Amen to that. The Rising collection in no way advocates war\u2014and that very brief, intimate moment in which Bruce directed his thoughts to the audience really just added to the entire experience and is indicative of what Mr. Springsteen and his music have always been about. Other highlights were a manic, intensely-played Saint in the City, where Bruce kept urging Roy to extend that end jam \u2014 amazing to have witnessed. For me, Worlds Apart is always a highlight \u2014 just love that song and its lyrics. Jersey Girl on the piano was beautiful and The Beatle's Tell me Why was a pleasant, sing-along surprise. Wish he'd bring back Ramrod, She's the One and Backstreets, but even without those, the show was, as always, no less than what one would come to expect of Springsteen and the E street Band \u2014 amazing!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Bill Noke</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Bruce was as loose as he's been at his Holiday Shows in Asbury. Actually expected a louder sing-a-long from the crowd at the end of \"Jersey Girl\" \u2014 Bruce turned the mike to the audience, looking for the crowd to carry it. The band entering to a Bert Parks overdub of \"There she is, Miss America!\" was hysterical! Clarence milked it, acting like he strolling down the runway! This show had it all \u2014 the topical power of \"Empty Sky\", the nostalgia of \"Saint In The City\", the beauty of \"Jersey Girl\", and the fun of \"Roll Of The Dice\". In Bruce's words: \"We're gonna have a Jersey Houseparty tonight!\" Awesome.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

A couple of months ago (not sure exactly) tix for this show went on sale. The booths set to open at 10 AM, me and my cousin both diehards went to the Dunk at about 11\u00a0o clock the night before. We were about the 20th people in line, and I was a little upset about this. After a while I realized that the people in front of us had absolutely no clue who they were waiting for. These people were trashy, scum of the earth cousin loving street hounds, working for some run of the mill king shit businessman ticket scalper. It made me completely sick. Much to my delight however, the first person in line was a loyal Bruce fan. He had gotten there at 4 PM. Anyway, the next morning they opened the doors, and in order to rid out the scalpers from getting the best seats, they did a \"lottery\". My cousin and I ended up being number 17, 18, or something like that, but our buddy at the front of the line was moved way back to 100 something. The scalpers still got all the GA seats, and me, my cousin, and my buddy all were forced to get \"Best Available\". Fortunately for us, the seats weren't so bad. I hate Scalpers. Anyway, the show, GA or not, was worth the wait and then some. Bruce was very very loose compared to the other shows I had seen him in. Making joking notions towards \"X-Rated Movies\" and being a \"Sex-Machine in his dreams.\" My girlfriend found that very intriguing. He exhibited very silly, very excited behavior, probably because Patti wasn't there to tie him up. One of the top 3 Bruce shows I've ever seen. The intimate crowd at the Dunk was great\u2026Band could have been just a little louder. I dressed up like Rising Bruce for the show, in tight black jeans, a button shirt and a sharp vest and blazer. This is very unusual for an 18 yr. old kid, but I have pretty much adopted it as my all the time attire. Spirit in the Night felt almost completely out of nowhere, and Clarence was as stellar as I've ever heard him. Thunder Road, which I missed at the last show, was also uniquely sung, and had a soft Federici organ giving it an almost \"Rising\" sort of feel. Night hit the spot early in the show\u2026 Ramrod however, brought down the house for me, with an extended Bittan piano solo, which has to sound like Heaven, or something better.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Tom Cantillon</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">An impressive show from start to finish! Of the 14 Rising Tour shows I've seen, this was one of the best. Bruce opened with a thundering version of War and kept on rocking hard with Night and Candy's Room. I had forgotten how great The Fuse is live \u2014 and Spirit in the Night was a sensually delivered version that drove the crowd wild. Should I Fall Behind was a beautiful, piano version which led into a passionate Into the Fire with everyone standing and singing along. Nice to see Ramrod back, the song works much better than Glory Days. Bruce and the band delivered one of the most intense versions of Born in USA I've ever seen them play and My City of Ruins simply keeps getting better. Bruce and band rocked extremely hard this night and kept the crowd on their feet for the duration of the show. It would be nice to see some rare additions such as: Racing in the Street, The Price you Pay, Reason to Believe, Living Proof and I think Drive all Night would work beautifully within the structure of his setlist. Maybe down the road.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

It was a different show from back then but it caught the mood of the crowd, who didn't seem to know whether it was ok to get into rock n roll given the events of the day. My highlights, Thunder Road without fail. I wanted to hear more, I couldn't believe it was over so soon. No songs from my favourite album, The Wild The Innocent\u2026.

He gave us Out in the Street, he gave us Thunder Road\u2026HE GAVE US RAMROD FOR FUCKS SAKE!!! There was nothing more disheartening than seeing a brilliant musician playing his guts out and having the most dismal of receptions [ie.by the cast of the Telstra boardroom] in my own hometown\u2026 when Bruce says \"that's pathetic\" during the dismal crowd chant of \"Waitin on a sunny day\", joking or not\u2026 we have a problem. You dont pay $152/$82 to sit down [or generally sway] for the most exhilarating of experiences. If this show was in another [non-corporate] forum, surely the crowd would have been \u2026\u2026.. alive? I even heard people say\u2026he didn't even play Born in the USA!!! - check the setlist.

An emotional and riveting 3 hour show, top set list and a generally fanatical audience, despite some corporate types wasting space near the stage. Back where I watched the show every one had a ball! An emotional opening, with a powerful \"Born In The USA\", solo acoustic-slide, similar to the Tom Joad tour. On the day US and Australian troops began the offensive in Iraq the significance of the song was clear, and anyone left with doubts would have had them blown away when the band kicked in to a searing \"War\". The power and emotion didn't let up through \"The Rising\" and \"Lonesome Day\", a fast and thrilling \"No Surrender\" and \"Prove It All Night\", fresh and sounding almost like a newly written song. The \"Rising\" songs were better in concert than their recorded versions, each one growing or gaining something live, and the band were energetic and intense. After a haunting \"Into The Fire\" and a brief, heart felt wish for the safety of US and Australian troops, as well as Iraqi civilians, it was party time, with the encores pushing the already enthralled audience to arm waving, fist pumping, hoarse voiced delirium. Bruce was bouncing around like an 18 year old, and although there were no long song intros or stories, the music said it all; intense, personal &amp; emotional, lightened with a deft touch of goofy fun and party spirit. When it all wound up with a fast paced \"Dancing In The Dark\" and a bouncy, extended \"Glory Days\" no one could possibly have asked for more.

I wouldn't be surprised if the set list got changed on the hop to allow for this fact as well as we saw quite a few BITUSA songs come through near the end. My seat sucked, the crowd sucked, the stadium sound was atrocius but the band rocked hard trying to overcome all of these shortcomings with the venue and the 'fans'. I wish I had gone to Brisbane instead where it was a much smaller venue. All in all, always happy as to have been there, just want to make it to a Springsteen concert where I actually get up front (if you buy a ticket in the first minute in Australia you end up miles from the front - reserve seating sucks!). I remember my second back row seat during Tom Joad tour at Capitol Theatre in Sydney pissed me as well - thankfully, it was still way close compared to Docklands\u2026.

And you ignore the terrible acoustics in what is a God-forsaken and heartless stadium, breathing in the magic elixir, like the addict you are. Yes, he was subdued at the start - an impending war will do that to those with a conscience - but when he warmed up, he was very good. Like you knew he would be. You think the new stuff was 'freaky' good, especially with some eerie lighting. The classic stuff reminds you why you've got millions of little hairs running down your neck and into the deepest parts of your spine. Can he still go?

For three hours I was transported to a place of pure joy. From the opening chord of 'Born in the USA' to the close of 'Glory Days', my three friends and I were enthralled by the best band on the planet. Of course, there are always songs you wish were played (they got \"Jungleland\" in Sydney!), but the mix of new songs and old could not have disappointed too many people. The only thing that marred the show slightly was the corporate front-row seating. Some people don't realize that the band can only see a few rows out into the crowd because of the lights. Bruce wasn't too pleased because the only people he could see didn't seem to be enjoying themselves. We saw the Tom Joad tour in 1997 and Bruce by himself was awesome and if I had never seen this show, that would have still been the highlight of my life. I missed the Born in the USA tour in 1985 (too young to drive and too far from Melbourne), and so have spent the last eighteen years waiting and hoping that the full E Street experience would be mine to savor. I don't have to wait any more. Thanks Bruce, Steve, Clarence, Roy, Danny, Max, Garry, Patti, Nils and Soozie.

Another happy moment was seeing the Bada Bing sign get a smile and laugh from Stevie and Bruce. At the time Sopranos was a cult show in Melbourne with show times all over the place.

Here's a viewpoint on the performance from someone who was close enough to the front to enjoy good sound. Admittedly there were 4 power failures, but these only served to build a bond between band and audience. He opened with a solo 12-string acoustic version of Born in the USA followed by the Edwin Starr classic War (what is it good for?) with full band when the first power outage occurred. To see the look on Springsteen s face change from frustration to joy when he heard the 30,000 audience spontaneously respond to the failure by continuing to chant the chorus until the power came back on was priceless. Although newer material from The Rising and crowd faves from Born in the USA dominated, Bruce dug deep into his back catalogue pulling out classics such as Darkness on the Edge of Town, Out in the Street, Backstreets and of course Born to Run which would ve blown the roof off the SCG if it had one. His harmonica playing on The Promised Land thrilled. Of course the E-Street Band offered more than able support. Clarence Clemons superb sax playing was highlighted on powerful anthems like Thunder Road and Badlands, guitarist Nils Lofgren played a beautiful extended intro to Counting on a Miracle, and Roy Bittan got to shine on Ramrod. Bruce thanked the audience for helping them get through the sound problems in the first hour of the show and seemed determined to make it up to us by playing on for an incredible 3 hours and 20 minutes without a break! The man's energy level is amazing and he can still manage a knee slide or two across the stage and climb a speaker stack. His final treat for us was to bring out the rarely played Rosalita, which had the arena jumping. The audience wouldn t let him go and after a quick band consultation they ripped into an all out jam on Darlington County to complete a truly memorable evening.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Greg Baker</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Wow! I saw Springsteen last time he was in Sydney on the Tom Joad tour, but last night was the first time I've seen him with the band. Nothing can prepare you for the sheer energy, showmanship and optimism of a full blast concert. Not even ten years of listening to bootleg CDs of classic concerts. The sound was a bit dodgy and failed four times, but each time the band improvised like a group that's played together for thirty years. After the troubles, Bruce laughed and joked. And he certainly put in an extra effort to more than make up for the problems. So, the actual show\u2026. Where do I start? The Born in the USA / War opening ripped through the night. Most of The Rising album was played, and with passion. A good mix of rocking tracks from Darkness and The River and Born in the USA. Throw in Backstreets and this fan nearly passed out. I've waited years to hear Thunder Road live and last night it happened. Words can't describe. This was the highlight for me and the end of the first part of the show. There were no pauses before the first encore. Bobby Jean, Ramrod, Born to Run\u2026 all played with unbelievable adrenalin. Bruce slowed the band and took to piano for My City of Ruins, then dedicated Land of Hope and Dreams to those in Iraq. Then into the final phase\u2026Dancing in the Dark and the stadium erupted, Glory Days and then Rosalita (!!!!!!!!!). And finally, with the crowd exhausted, the show ends with Darlington County and Bruce saying he'll never forget Sydney. Nor will the Sydney-folk at the show forget him and his band.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Diego Gonzalez</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Man what a show. I saw the band back in '85 when I was only 17and have always told everybody who would listen, that it was the greatest rock n roll show ever.

I saw them 5 times in 1985 in Sydney and this concert was everything and more - with Little Stevie by his side, Bruce seemed to genuinely enjoy himself. The band was tight and by the end of the show, the crowd was wearier than the Boss who undoubtedly would have done more but for the noise restrictions (which he'd already breached by playing on 'til 11.30PM). Highlights - Rosalita, Born to Run, Thunder Road and Mary's Place, but they were all brilliant. He showed Sydney last night that he truly is The Boss.

But then again the same can be said for the English cricket team. But as the the show opened with Born in the USA then War, I thought the sound was dreadful, very tinny and bouncing back, then for the first time that night the power went off. I sat there feeling miserable. It was nearly 18 years since I last saw Springsteen, back in 1985 at Roundhay Park, Leeds, before that 1981 at the NEC. A lot has changed since then I now live in Sydney for a start. I thought this is a mistake coming back to see him after all these years, has the guy lost it? Well after 3 hours and 30 minutes the answer is a resounding NO! The guy is brilliant, a genius, I didn't want him to go off to stage and neither did Bruce. Rosalita and Thunder Road were an added bonus. 3 times I have seen him, not many I know but each time it has been at differant stages in my life and each time a different partner has accompanied me! Bruce you still have it.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Peter Hickey</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">I just wished to forward my thoughts from one of the greatest nights in my life. As an Aussie, we have waited long &amp; hard for Bruce to bring the band down here. Well the wait was worth it. Thursday night I got to the front of the stage for most of the gig in Melbourne. Unfortunately with current events in Iraq, the band &amp; the crowd were understandably subdued. That's not to say we didn't love the show, it was all &amp; more than I expected. But it didn't have the joyous vibe I was hoping for. Luckily I went to Sydney last night. In Australian colloquialism \"The show was a balltearer.\" Apart from the four power outages that interrupted four separate songs. When the lighting, sound &amp; screens all died at these points, Max belted the skins as hard as he could, Bruce and the rest of the band led the crowd in clapping along to whatever the song was, (War, Rising, Waiting &amp; Worlds Apart) and a very enthusiastic Sydney crowd sang at the top of their voices until power could be restored, usually after a couple of minutes. Bruce joked about the problem but after the third drop out it was clear he was getting a bit peeved. The band seemed to really enjoy the night, &amp; Bruce worked much harder on his voice than he had in Melbourne (where he had worked his fingers off on the guitar). The crowds patience with the nuisance power was more than rewarded. We got 3 and a half hours and something I never even dreamed I'd get to see. Rosie was played as the fifth song in the second encore. Bruce started by saying this is a song we don't play very often so they might be a bit rusty. Rusty it was not. The joy that the crowd felt was mirrored by the band as they belted out the showstopper of all showstoppers. Clarence was enormous on the sax. If that was not enough, the band didn't seem to want to leave, neither did the crowd. Bruce offered up one last song, saying the band hadn't been down here since the early eighties so we should probably play something from that era. And a rollicking version of Darlington County concluded the night of my life. Now I'm off to the last 2 Aussie shows in Brisbane later this week. I doubt they could top Sydney, May my hope bring you hope.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Colin Jones</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">The most disappointing concert experience of my life. The technical problems that beset this show ensured that it never gained any momentum until the band hit the stage for the encores. The SCG was 3/4 full at most also contributing to a lack of energy or excitement throughout the night. The sound was shocking, like listening to The River album playing through $2 speakers wrapped inside a blanket. There were some people in the front section that appeared to be having a good time. As for the middle-outer ring of punters, the only time I saw any movement was when the beer needed a refill or when they'd decided that enough was enough and headed off home. One of the few rock concerts when you actually needed to stay to the end in order to beat the rush to the carpark. In the midst of early days of the Iraq invasion, Springsteen opened with the moving and passionate acoustic Born In The USA, followed by War. The show was set to be a memorable one, perhaps making the ultimate show-stopping technical problems a greater frustration. As for the tour premiere of Rosalita? I was already in the carpark and to be perfectly honest, didn't feel like I was missing very much. As for Bruce, well he was obviously embarrassed but just seem to laugh it off. Sorry would have been a nice gesture. The promoter blamed Springsteen management who blamed the promoter who blamed\u2026. Less than 6 months after this tour finished, the promoter (a long time Australian promoter of international acts) virtually went bust. Springsteen's name was mentioned in dispatches to the shareholders\u2026from start to finish and beyond this tour was a mess.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

And is indescribable. Remember how long the year used to be until Christmas? And how Christmas Eve was never ending? Felt like those presents were never going to arrive. 25 years is a long time too. 12 hours in the pouring rain is even longer. 2 minutes while the rest of the band files on stage until the reason for the wait actually appears, is an eternity. Suddenly, he is there, centre stage looking so familiar that you have an urge to say, \"Hey man! There you are! What kept you?\" A whole song crawls past. He's tweaked it and changed it and you know it but it feels a bit different and you're suddenly not sure. In fact it just takes a bit of getting used to and before the thought \"man forget the 25 years, I've been waiting all DAY in the rain\" can really take hold, he's counting off the next song. And it happens. The magic. Suddenly a jean clad, 53-year-old storyteller has grabbed you by the hand you're off. It doesn't matter how much faith you have that it exists, until your experience the magic in the night it is still only a line from a song. One of the best lines from one of the best songs. But just a line. Sue has waited 25 years for that magic. Growing up with a love of cars and racing she's been waiting in the rain since 9 am. Waiting for the engines to roar, the flag to go down and the racing to begin. At 5.30 when his voice floats out from the stadium during the sound check it is all a bit much. She's not alone - like the girls melting on the beach, he was so close but so out of reach. But you can't tell the tears from the rain so it is okay. And 3 hours later he speaks the words that change and unite us all forever: \"Long as I remember, the rains been pouring down\" With the closing \"who'll stop the rain?\" the rain stops. A split second of silence as the crowd realizes what's happening and then with a roar everyone climbs on board - for some a motorbike, some a 69 Chevy with a 396, some a train, some just take his hand and walk along side. And with a warning that there will be no surrender, he takes us on a trip. The damp and cold forgotten, friendships spring up in the darkness as the crowd try on newer songs and admire the fit only to swap them a minute later for the older more comfortable fit of a Promised Land. Not a single one is left on the rack. For well over an hour, we race with him. For some it is a return trip - the ride as good as the ones before. Doreen and Tara visit roads they have only imagined. For Rex a 25-year dream comes true. For Jose it is a conversion from a guy who liked a few songs to one who has found a reason to believe. And while visiting Mary's place and meeting the people who help tell the story, he kindly lets us have a glimpse of the man behind the storyteller - yeh sure it always works at home man! Asking his passengers to show a little faith, there's magic in the night is met with a roar of approval and yet of loss. He's stopping the ride already? He's walking away. Man, haven't YOU been listening to US? We might be at the other end of the world but WE BELIEVE! You can't go yet! All day man. IN THE RAIN! Obviously enjoying the power of driving 25,000 people down that long dusty road, he's back and for the next 45 minutes brings out some old friends. Now, night magic is one thing. Saying the magic formula and have the crowd give the magic back to you is quite another - and clearly it never loses its appeal for this street poet. Abracadabra will never have the power of that \"1-2-3-4\" that you know is introducing Born To Run and turns 25,000 people from the other end of the world into a single voice. In the space of an image, the driver becomes the passenger and finally listens. He believes. Knows that we were there all this time, listening, and waiting. 10 years down the road, 15 years down the road, 25 years down the road. And thanks to the video screens, the passengers see the storyteller suddenly understand and they sing a little louder. Just to say thank you at last. This time as he walks away, there is no disappointment - for there is no doubt that we have performed the magic this time. He'll come back out. Whether he intended to or not is no longer the question - when he comes back, it will be different because the passengers have proved themselves. And out he comes. To talk to his passengers. And to listen. Listen to Sue who got to stand next to the stage, - a fitting reward for 25 years of devotion and who had the courage to speak for us all and ask him to come back. Listen to Kirk who was somewhere in the darkness, driven like the rest of us to be there but unable to really explain why. Listen to Annette who thanked them for us - not just for coming but also for being. He may not have heard the individual voices but he at last heard all of us. For around 3 hours, he took us by the hand, drove us around, told us stories. And wove the magic that is Bruce Springsteen's: of bringing people together as one. Whatever happens now that will never change. Should he never get back in the driver's seat, it won't matter for the ride will never end. Just close your eyes. And there he is: against the midnight sky - Dancing in the Dark.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Sarah Macmillan</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Thank you for helping me to relive the memories of the Magic in the Night!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

He must have lost someone special or something. Heck, the song itself is just really emotional no matter your situation.<br/>\nNext was Waitin' and at this point, the crowd was gettin pretty motivated after showing signs of things to come during Who'll Stop The Rain, NO SURRENDER, Rising and Lonesome Day. The sing-a-long was solid. Bruce pushedus big time, we delivered, he was impressed. I still love Soozie on that violin for all songs, but especially this one. Next, I saw the harmonica so I knew what was coming and was very happy about it \u2014 PROMISED LAND and what a nice job he did on it. Heaps of passion, man!! After the song, he gave his harmonica to a young kid of 10 or so who was up real close in the pit. Next was World's Apart and I will say that I used to think it slowed the show down - NOT ANYMORE!!! Another reason why you had to be there. Bruce's guitar solo in this one was FUCKING AMAZING. He went ape shit on the guitar. It was like he thought that they were never gonna let him play again. It was amazing, so rocking, so screaching that it is beyond description. The best part is that he followed it up with a great BADLANDS - lots of crowd interplay - and more amazing guitar action. She's The One was next and it is really not one of my favorites, but again like in Worlds Aprart, he delivered with an incredible display on the harmonica to end the song \u2014 shows how talented this guy is and how much stamina he has \u2014 from Waitin rigth thru this point, he was beating the shit out of himself physically, it was insane!! So he goes into Mary's Place and is going bezerk again.<br/>\nI will add some notes in here cuz it is apporiate. Not sure where for all of them, but he brought back some Reunion Tour lingo last night. I think he is trying to slant the shows now to more house party, less somber 9/11 feel, ya know. He did \"Is Anybody Alive Out There?\" at some point, sorry, I forget where. He screamed out \"Sacramento\" I think at some stage a la LINYC and \"New York City!!!\" And in Mary's Place, the band intros were long and hot !! He let the crowd partially intro Max \u2014 the \"late night tellyvision\" part !!! and the best was when he introduced Patti (WHO WAS LOOKING VERY HOT LAST NIGHT, brown suede jacket, black pants, mmm). He broke into \"Rescue Me\" and then started dancing around Patti like he was having a seizure or something for what seemed like forever. She was clearly embarassed, but having fun. He was, as I think the band has spoke of before, acting like a maniac, and he said that she acts like she does not like it now, but \"it works all the time at home!\" Very funny. So, he is going nuts during Mary's Place \u2014 and does he second slide across the stage after splashing water on his legs \u2014 and I think he hurt himself a bit \u2014 must have been a groin strain or something.<br/>\nBecause at the end of Mary's Place, he goes to Nils and I think he tells him to play Countin' early and go long on his gutair intro or both cuz Bruce was stretching and grimacing while Nils was playing. Countin' rocked and the crowd was singing it well, which was nice. Bruce was okay and after Countin', here we go, after the first key on the piano, I knew it was time for JUNGLELAND!!! Need I say more, wonerful version. Next up: a riveting Into The Fire with more great stuff from Patty on the intro and throughout. And they leave the stage.<br/>\nEncore #1 \u2014 At this point, I was concerned we were not gonna get Thunder Road, but here they come and Bruce has a harmonica in hand. Is it gonna be This Hard Land?? Nope, thankfully it is Thunder Road sung with more than the usual passion \u2014 at this point, he was floored by the crowd's energy, I think. Next, an incredibly long and rockin' version of Ramrod (they left the stage, except for Roy who kept playing, and came back out from the side during the song, AMAZING, ya had to be there!) followed by a HIGH energy BTR. After it, as they were saying goodbye at the edge of the stage, Bruce turned to Steven, smiled and said something, and I could read Steven's lips as he said to Bruce, \"Yeah, That WAS Good!\" I think they were all really happy with the energy from both sides. Ya know, we were \"in concert with the band!\"<br/>\nEncore #2 \u2014 He hits the piano, thanks us for comin' out, and says what \"a fabulous audience\" we have been, thanks for the food bank and does MCOR for the food bank people. MCOR was solid, but if I could see anything drop from the encores this might be it. Give me The River or London Calling, whatever. Next, he hits the mic as LOHAD starts and says \"we're gonna do this one as a prayer for peace, and a prayer for the safety of our sons and daughters and the Iraqi civilians - this is The Land of Hope and Dreams!\" Great stuff, it rocked, and the \"People Geeeeeet Ready\" CODA was awesome. gkid8 and I like it alot !!! So after a LOOOOOONG Ramrod and a LOOOOOONG LOHAD, I think they were seriously gonna end the show. Well the crowd went fuckin ape shit. The place got about ten times louder than at any other point of the show (so that is LOUD) and people were screaming \"one more, Bruce, please!\" and \"two more!!\" I was yelling \"three more!!!\" So, he plays a little game with us, looking at Clarence and using body language and facial expressions to say \"no, they don't deserve it\" although he knew full well we did. So, he gives in and kicks of DITD with great pogoing and the usual and fantastic facial contortions and the like through the lyrics. This song went on forever and as it was ending the crowd went wild again, soooo Bruce basically said, what the hell, this crowd is fucking amazing, quite a surprise (total paraphrase there) and he tore into Darlington County. He got a cowboy hat, good stuff. BUT, this is another ya had to be there thing. The song lasted forever, and he had us singing along on the \"sh la la, la la la\" part. He made the band stop and we did that part alone. Lots of crowd interplay and they all lined up and waved their asses at us at one point \u2014 Patti's ass is sweet, man!! Bruce's ain't bad either!!<br/>\nThree hours in the books and they leave to thundering applause and appreciation. The kid who got the harmonica from Bruce ended up getting Max's drumsticks - given to him personally by Max.<br/>\nAnyway, I may have more to say later, but the show was one for the ages. Was more than I expected, and I expected ALOT as you all well know. I walked out of there thinking what I always think after a Bruce show. So many thoughts and emotions \u2014 but the main ones, what an amazing performer Bruce is and I always reflect on exactly why and how he and his music make me feel the way that they do. I mean I cry, I laugh, I get chills, my heart pounds at double speed \u2014 it is something else. I really feel like I am one with Bruce, the fans, and all that is good (or righteous!). It is truly a religous experience for me, a guy who is not very religous in the traditional sense. It is something that I am just happy to be fortunate enough to experience. I am happy that it is part of my life. Bruce's music and lyrics have taken me thru life \u2014 good, bad, and in between \u2014 so it was really special.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Jack Tayson</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">I flew up from San Diego because even though Bruce wrote about San Diego in some famous song you might know he has not come since the acoustic show in I think 93. Anyway what can you say he is still and will always be the Boss. Just as Clarence will always be the Big Man or the King of the Universe! Perfect sound and a fresh band , you could tell! Outside of the Arco it was as mellow as I have ever seen! And when Bruce asked for silence, as Usual everyone obeyed the what he said! To me it is Spiritual, and the only place to be is on the floor in the middle of the crowd dancing your butt off and feeling the vibe of of the entire Audience. I could see alot of grey on his beard and his hair. But he still rocks like the first time I saw him in 78. If their was ever a need to clone someone, then we all know Bruceeeeeeeeeeeeeeee would be the one! Hopefully He'll live to be 110 and then that would assure we see him again and again.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Peggy Hannan</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Drove up to SF grabbed a friend that's never seen em and headed east.

Bruce was more into the crowd here than anytime I've seen him. \"Badlands\" is always my favorite song of the set, but it was equalled by \"Ramrod\" on this night. During this jam, Bruce grabbed a 'coon skin cap from a guy in the front row and after putting it on, proceeded to lead the entire band (with instruments) in single file, funky chicken walk off the stage. All the lights went out and Professor Roy was the only one left on stage with a lone spotlight as he proceeded to play some 5 minute honky tonk piano solo while Bruce &amp; the band were making their way about 5 rows deep into the general floor seating area (escorted by security of course). Roy continued with the spotlight solo until the entire band was back on stage, lights came on and they finished banging out the rest of \"Ramrod\". I was definitely in \"Boss\" heaven for that part.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

It was probably safer for everyone concerned that I be at the back of the pit with a bit more room to move around! The concert was fantastic from the word go. I haven't seen that many concerts in Calgary and haven't run into that many Springsteen fans since moving here, so I wasn't sure what the crowd would be like. I didn't really have to worry - the Boss sure got everyone charged up quickly. He said, fairly early in the show \"Look at this crowd, you'd think we were in Jersey!\" I take that as a compliment. The highlight for me was Jungleland - when I heard the first few notes I went wild and for a moment thought maybe I was mistaken as nobody else 'got it'. Then the song started and everyone got into it. It was beautiful. There was a group of young (er) fans (probably late teens) who were pogo-ing through the whole concert. They were pretty visible as they were at the centre-back of the pit and all wearing white t-shirts. I noticed them missing at one point and found out later that they had been invited back stage to meet the Boss. Lucky kids. I'm posting this a year and a half after the show, but I still have a smile on my face as I think about it. We had driven from Calgary to Fargo (17 hours) for the Fargo show in Sept, but this Calgary one was much better. Being in the pit was a marvelous experience and being at the back of the pit meant I could see the whole stage and everyone was up close. Nils still blows me away with his guitar playing and Bruce seems to get better with each show I see. This was fantastic and I did not want it to end.

Quite a few different songs from the previous night in Calgary, including the one mentioned above I'm not familiar with the name\u2026 Bruce said it was a treat for Edmonton that Calgary didn't get. Detroit medley was special treat as well. Very high energy show from start to finish\u2026 unfortunate the crowd was much less than capacity, maybe 10000 out of 16000 venue\u2026 but didn't seem to affect the band as they gave it 100%. The crowd in Calgary was jam packed and really into it big time. Edmonton was much more subdued and not as familiar with the songs (only second time Bruce has played Edmonton and first with THE Band - first time was the Better days tour). So considering the crowd, was very special to get the rare songs. Bruce made a number of comments about the fact Edmonton is famous for Wayne Gretzky\u2026 a bit boring for Edmonton people who are tired of it since its been 12 years since Gretzky left and don't want to be reminded we are along ways from the top of the hockey world today. Not alot else to say\u2026 was a real treat.. fabulous, high energy once in a lifetime show worth the over $100 ticket price (which was likely big reason so many fans stayed away).</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Had seen Tampa, Toronto, Buffalo since 1999 with Buffalo being part of the Rising tour. Bruce was simply the best I had seen him in any of those four concerts. Lots of energy. Two stage slides. One real collision with Clarence (and Clarence went down real hard but didn't miss a note). The Ottawa Crowd hadn't seen Bruce in 22 years and he gave a full out 25 song, 2 hour and 50 minutes show that left them breathless. Not quite the old Civic Centre with only 2,000 patrons but he made it seem like we were all on the Jersey Shore in a small bar as he started up with \"I'm on Fire\" and \"Grow'in Up\".

Mostly recovered from his cold and with a little more jump in his legs Bruce audibled \"Growin' up\" to the delight of thousands. \"I'm on fire\" was also fanatastic. Disaster averted, a funny moment occured during \"Ramrod\" when The Boss and The Big Man got tangled up and hit the Deck. Without missing a beat and rolling to his knees, Clarence belted out his sax portion of the song! The \"Detroit Medley\" really had the crowd jumping ! Bruce and the boys whipped the crowd into a frenzy song after song finally closing up with \"Dancing in the dark\". Bruce promised the 18,500 faithful they wouldn't have to wait another 22 years.

The crowd was up for the duration of the show and I believe that kept Bruce pumped. One of the highlights of the show, and of the tour, is the piano version of Incident! Beautifully rendered and a song I hope stays on the setlist for the summer tour. Ramrod was simply out of control and definitely one of the best songs of the night \u2014 Bruce has so much fun with this one \u2014 reminds me of the days of the River Tour. And when he rockets thru Born to Run and into the Detroit Medley, all hell breaks loose \u2014 what an intense combo. My City of Ruins still leaves me with chills. Hopefully, during the summer tour Bruce will break out some classics like: Drive all Night, Price you Pay, Living Proof and Racing in the Streets. Amazing show! The Rising material is intensely spiritual and a welcomed relief to the pop-oriented Born in USA material.

I was standing in the center on the floor about 60 feet from the band. By the 3rd song Bruce's grey shirt was clearly soaked with sweat. Of course it was like any Bruce show, just a total outpouring of love for Bruce and the Band. Everyone jumped to their feet when he came out and stayed that way until he and Patti did a couple of quieter songs. At that point he told the crowd he needed a bit of quiet and we actually listened to him! It was way too warm in the building and I noticed Mighty Max kept sliding his glasses up his nose, he was sweating so profusely, trying to keep time at the same time. I kept screaming for Jungleland and/or Rosalita but never got them. He did mostly songs off \"The Rising\" . A particular highlight was \"Incident on 57th Street\". It was amazing to see him solo on piano singing this very delicate song after screaming out the rockers for a couple of hours. His voice seemed to get stronger as the show went on , it was unbelievable. Only complaint was the sound was a bit muddy, making it hard to pick out some of the early guitar solos, especially Bruce's. I am having trouble getting this concert out of my head. I am 40 years old and have been an avid concertgoer since the age of 16. I had seen Bruce before in 1984 when he came to Montreal. Its a 8 and a half hour drive from where I live, Fredericton, New Brunswick. I have seen an awful lot of concerts over the years but now I can die happy. I just saw the best one of my life. Bruce is an absolute marvel and I love him and the E Street Band - they make me believe in the incredible power of rock 'n roll.

The first thing about the show in general, is that the second half was better because it was really really evening\u2026 The darkness sets the mood. It started of with \"Born in the USA\", which I only like acoustic, so it was fine for me. There's nothing much to say about \"The Rising\" and \"Lonesome Day\"\u2026 Just great songs. The're already classics. \"No Surrender\" surprised me!! After hearing this song from the \"Live 1975-1980\" album, I didn't want to hear it from BITUSA anymore, but after the rocking version of yesterdaynight\u2026.. WOW. \"The Promised Land\" is one of my personal favourites (this was the part where I left my seat, moved to the side and started jumping and clapping with some other unknown guys) and I'd love to hear it again on thursday. I only like the live version of \"Empty Sky\", because I think the drums fuck up the emotion of the song (same opinion about \"My City Of Ruins\" where the drums start to early on the studio album IMHO). Some dickheads in the audience started clapping with the chorusses like it was \"Better Days\" which really ruined the atmosphere a bit\u2026 I really missed Patti here\u2026 Maybe better luck on thursday. \"Your're Missing\" sounds wonderful live\u2026 One of the highlights of the show for me. \"Waiting on a sunny Day\"\u2026 I gotta stay polite now, but I hate the song, so this was my chance to chase for some beer\u2026 I started waiting\u2026. (NOT for a sunny day). During \"Darlington County\" I was still waiting\u2026. \"Should I go back or keep waiting, 'cause then my waiting will be rewarded?\" was the only thought then\u2026 I decided to wait! I should've left\u2026. 'cause the beerbarrels were empty when it was my turn\u2026. I went back to the action (with a damn Sisi, and a very pissed of mood) and \"Worlds Apart\" started\u2026 Bruce couldn't have a better timing!! This is my 2nd favourite Rising song (\"Paradise\" is still #1) and it rocked my ass off!! (RMAO) I was jumping and clapping with the unknown guys again (I'd like to see you try that\u2026. Clapping and holding/drinking Sisi at the same time:))<br/>\n\"Badlands\"\u2026 was great ofcourse. I noticed that I was in a group of people that didn't know what to do in the Oooooh-Oh-Oh-Oooooh-Ooooooh part\u2026. The'll remember it for the next time! \"Out in the streets\" was nice to hear\u2026 One of the few happy songs that I like. \"Mary's Place\" is a song that I can't stand on the studio album, but it's a great great live song. The audience partitian was great here. \"Countin' on a miracle\" is a nice song, but I could've done without it\u2026 I love the bridge in the song\u2026 Bruce sat down behind the piano could'n get the intro of \"Incident on 57th street\" right\u2026 After 2 or 3 attempts, Bruce blew his nose (quickly after, the videoscreens were out). A guy behind me kept screaming \"Point Blank!!\"\u2026. It would be fun if it worked but it didn't take long for \"Incident\" to begin\u2026. WOW!!! It seemed that I was the only only in the section around me who love it! People started moving to the toilets and to wherever the were moving\u2026. In the middle of Incident, for Christ sake!!! Unbelievable\u2026. Now I've seen my 3 favourite Bruce songs live (Also Jungleland in 1999 in Arnhem and Thunder Road) Thanks a lot Bruce!! \"Thunder Road\" is one of my personals favourites (one of everybody's favourites!!), and I think that this one together with \"Born to Run\" should be in every Bruce and the ESB show I never liked \"Into the Fire\" but there's the acapella ending was wonderful\u2026 truly tastefull \"Bobby Jean\" sounded great except for parts on the sax-solo. Clarence missed a few notes but I love the whole \"sad-but rocking\" concept of the song. \"Ramrod\" went on a bit too long for me (but not for the ones in the front I guess ), but the first 23,5 minutes of the song were fantastic\u2026 No \"Born to Run\" means no complete Bruce show I think. It's one of garanteed successes in a show. They audience went berserk in my section! It was the first time ever for me to hear \"Detroit Medley\" (really), so this was also one of the highlights of the show\u2026 I knew all the songs but I never heard the Bruce and the ESB version\u2026 The stone-platform I was standing on was bouncing up and down, so you can say that it worked well. \"My City of Ruins\" moves me everytime I hear it. People around me started talking and laughing, which I didn't understand\u2026 This is one of the songs where everybody should shut up and enjoy the moment\u2026 And that's exactly what I did. Now comes the sad part\u2026 I had to leave the stadium during the end of \"Land of Hopes and Dreams\" because I agreed to meet my friends (who were in another part of the stadium) to make sure we would catch the last train home, but I enjoyed the first 5 or 6 minutes of the song\u2026. I was outside when \"Dancing in the Dark\" was played\u2026 I thanked God that Bruce didn't end with \"Jungleland\"! It was a relief in a way, that I don't like \"Dancing in the Dark\" Something about the sound\u2026 In the train I talked to some people who were in the pit, who said that the sound was great\u2026 I think the're right but when you're sitting in the back of the stadium (like I did) the sound was terrible\u2026 That's the discomfort of every stadium show performed by Bruce or by anyone. There were a few moments in where the videoscreens flickered, but 99,5\u00a0% of the time it was working just fine And now the positive parts\u2026. well that would be a very very long list\u2026 It was a very standard setlist for many of you but it was my first \"Rising\" tour show (tommorrow the 2nd ) so 16 of the songs were live debuts for me!! I got field tickets for tomorrow so I'll write another review then. This way I can compare the quality of the sound\u2026 I can't wait!!! It's been a great evening!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

So, me and my girlfriend had to wait until last night to see the boss again. Once again an unforgettable experience. I won't comment on the setlist, as far too many people do that these days. What should have stayed in? What should have been left out? Frankly I don't care what he plays. What matters is that every time i see Bruce Springsteen in concert, he touches me somewhere deep inside. I've seen him play in 1981, 1985, 1988, 1993, 1993 and 1999. So last night was only my 7th concert, but it blew me away, again. I go to his concerts like you go visiting an old friend. You go over and you wonder how he's doing. And every time I get the same response from Bruce: I'm fine man, thanks for visiting, and don't wait so long before coming 'round again. Nice to know that some things stay the same.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>more ice</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">What a great show! Having seen Tuesdays show also I must say that this was Bruce's best. I was there with my girl all the way up front, which provided me with great pictures of Bruce. Too bad though I got warned by the crew after shooting one during Cadillac Ranch. The big man missed a couple of notes, I think it was during the promised land, and Bruce broke a guitar string during She's The One\u2026 All though the show was minutes shorter, it was more dynamic!

What can I say? I just got back from Rotterdam! I've been to the first one too and I gotta say that I preferred last show\u2026 This night I had field tickets so I was standing close to the stage. The sound was great!! The first night it was shit because I was way back in the stadium\u2026 It makes a huge difference!! My father and I went together and we were both pleasantly surprised. I gotta explain that \"Darkness\u2026\" is (in constant battle with Born To Run) my favorite album, and what did I get this night of that?? Badlands, Promised Land, Candy's Room, Darkness on the Edge of town\u2026 and one of my old time favorites. Racing in the Streets. Especially that last song moved me tonight\u2026 I couldn't believe that I was witnessing it\u2026 Fantastic!! Thanks Bruce! And far more important: Thanks Rosie!! \"The Ties that Bind\" kicked away \"Out in the Street\" off the setlist of 2 nights before which I didn't mind at all\u2026 Though I love Out in the streets too\u2026 but\u2026 The Ties that Bind wins for me\u2026 \"Darkness on the Edge of Town\" (acoustic) was also a big surprise for me!! I love this version. I've known it from the \"The Ghost of Tom Joad\" single and I've always loved it!! \"Countin' on a Miracle\" is a song that I could miss in the set\u2026. And so it did for tonight\u2026. Make room for Cadillac Ranch!!! \"We haven't played it for a while so we might need a little help\" is what Bruce said about it\u2026 He kept on laughing during the song throughout the words\u2026 the fun and excitement was shining through him! Amazing! \"She's the One\" rocked really good!! Night is the only song that I haven't heard live from that album\u2026 So this was too shorten the list and to have a helluva great dancing time! I noticed during \"The Promised Land\" that Bruce was bleeding on one of his right hand fingers, but it didn't stop him at all\u2026 He didn't even payed attention to it\u2026 except for rubbing it clean once in a while \"Detroit Medley\" worked very good tonight (like two nights ago) just as \"Ramrod\" (man that rocks!!) This time the audience reacted very good on \"Empty Sky\" and \"You're Missing\"\u2026 The silence was dominating! All the Lalala/Nananana and Tututu songs (Darlington County, The Rising/Waiting on a Sunny day) worked very good\u2026 especially in the pit\u2026 I know now what I missed when I was sitting in the seats two days before!! After such a standard (but outstanding show!!) setlist as two nights ago, I didn't expect so many surprises (Like \"Two Hearts\" with the it-takes-two ending) but it was more than welcome!! This time he left the Back in your arms snippet away in \"Mary's Place\" but it worked very good!! \"My City of Ruins\" was moving me again\u2026. Beautiful song!! No more words needed Candy's Room, Racing in the Streets, The Ties that Bind, Cadillac Ranch, Darkness (acoustic)\u2026. Do I need to say more??? I feel like a lucky bastard!!!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

The show was fabulous with a wonderful setlist and a fantastic E Street Band! Everybody was in such a good shape that it was really a pleasure to watch them. Ramrod was a killer-song with a piano-solo from Roy of about 3-4 minutes (where the other band members left the stage and came back after 3-4 minutes behind Roy). Bruce was running and jumping very often, Clarence lost a lot of weight and Max was perfect as always. During Empty Sky and Missing the show dropped a little bit. Unfortunately he changed the setlist, because on the setlist was Devil, but they played Glory Days. The sound was very good, the screens also and the show was completely sold out - approximately 40.000 people.

But I bought tickets in advance for Gelsenkirchen and Hamburg, but not for this show. Yesterday night I got \"the FEVER\" and decided to attend one more - the first one in Germany scheduled in Ludwigshafen - although I really dislike \"open airs\" in May. After all these past live experiences in US, Europe and my home country, I can not to think anymore, that Bruce &amp; The E-Street-Band never can become better on stage than like the last performance I just visited. Now six hours have passed away, I am tired and a little bit drunk of everything, soI must write a comment at once. This show was sooooooooooo great, that I could not believe it. Not only, because they played some of my all time favorites of mine I unfortunately never have been attended live before - like \"Candy's Room\", \"Spirit In The Night\" or \"Racing In The Streets\". \u2026.but everybody on stage had fire on fingertips for more than two and a half hour. Now I will believe finally, that Bruce and his gang - by the way this time without Patti again - also in Germany do not only play for the masses. They first of all play for the real fans, who have been loving them for five, ten and perhaps twenty-five years (like me) . I seemed that plenty of dreams came true this night. Everybody danced, many kissed\u2026..the whole crowed was sooooooo happy.

My dad and Me had Some wishes on The Setlist - but apart from Because the Night they all came true. The band play really fantastic, the BOSS was in a very good mood (hangin' downwards on the microphone holder etc.) it was just great. It was not raining as in Paris but \"waitin' on a sunny day\" brought it up to the point. This show will be hardly topable (apart from the BOSS himself).

He spent 3 hours of virtually nonstop high energy rock and rolling showmanship, doing the cowboy dance in Cadillac Ranch, even hanging upside down from his microphone stand during Waitin' on a sunny day (how did he do it?), we were treated to a marathonlike Darlington County, after having had the pleasure of watching Jon Landau trying to dance during Dancing in the dark! Better Days was awesome, and I loved every second of My love will not let you down (my favorite from his concert here back in 99, pity they didn't also play Loose ends). Stevito, as he was introduced was great, and so was everybody. I seem to remember that he changed the lyrics during Cadillac ranch, hey little girlie in the blue jeans so tight, riding alone through the MADRID night, We also saw the band disappear during Ramrod only to come back harder and stronger, and yes Bruce we did know what time it was, but we didn't want to go to (as he said) la casa, cos it's taken you 4 years to come back to Madrid!

Now we saw Gelsenkirchen with many changes in the setlist and both shows were superb. I`m strolling to many concerts in the rock scene and saw Bruce the 14th time since 1985 at very different venues, but this tour breaks any hopes you can have. Marvelous! Energy on it`s highest level! \"Jungleland\" in Gelsenkirchen was like an opera in a church.

Let\u2019s start with the good news: The audience was very good, most of them were dancing from the beginning. The show was almost sold out with about 50.000 people(some empty seats were seen). I catched the front row once again to have contact with Steve and Patti. The band seemed to have a lot of fun during the show. Now the bad news: The setlist was only standard. No surprises, no special for the longtime fans of Germany. Bruce was also not as good as he was in Ludwigshafen or (as I heard) in Brussels. But the real bad news is that on the setlist (which we catched after the show) were these songs: Ties that bind, My love will not let you down, Roll of the dice, Human Touch and My Hometown. Can you believe it? He changed all the special ones into Bobby Jean, Thunder Road and so on. We were all a little bit angry, but \u2026\u2026 we will be in Paris once again.

I reminded that Bruce did a magnificent version of that anthem, back in April 1981, a few miles away from here in the Palais des Sports de St Ouen, for his first shows in France. I just lusted for him to start the show with this one, not for geopolitical reasons - well, not only ! - but because this song is indeed the \"mother of all covers\". And when, at 8:30 PM, Bruce hit the first verse \"Long as I remember, the rain's been falling down\", bang!, the crowd of approx. 40.000 freezed fans went completely wild. The rest was history. Well I can hardly wait to get that pure gem on the web ! The other highlights of this show were indisputably the older ones : The Ties That Bind, My Love Will Not Let You Down, Trapped, The Promised Land, Badlands, Out in the Street, Bobby Jean, and Born to Run. Best of all was Jungleland with a splendid duet intro of both Soozie an Roy, a fantastic sax solo from Mister C, and powerful and evocative vocals from Bruce. Be true was just OK, maybe a bit of an inappropriate downer after the crowd pleaser \"Waitin' on a sunny day\". The end of the show was wild again with Ramrod, and this cover Seven nights to rock, both with terrific piano parts from Professor Roy Bittan. When Bruce and the band launch the \"Land of Hope and dreams\". train, it began pouring cats and dogs. At the end of the song, Bruce couldn't help but stare, amazed at the sky and the pouring rain. As a reward to the stoic crowd, he decided to keep \"singing in the rain\", and closed the show with a blazing version of Dancing in the dark.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Joel</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">As i arrived at the stadium early on Saturday morning, it started to rain. Standing in line for the whole day, getting to share experiences with so many Bruce fans from all over the world was really worth it. As the rain was falling down, i bet with some fans that the we would get \"Who'll stop the rain\" as opener, as i did on the Reunion Tour in Copenhagen. A fan from the USA desperately wanted Jungleland. As the doors opened around 6:30\u00a0pm, people started to rush in. My only disappointment of the night goes to the F\u2026. machines at the entrance. For some reason, many of the fans, who had been waiting for hours couldn't get in because the tickets barcodes would not be read by the machines. I was one of those. I feel this is totally unacceptable for the organization of this kinda event with 50\u00a0000 people waiting at the gates. Anyway, after minutes of negotiation i was able to access the floor where, to my delight, Bruce was onstage with his guitar, leather jacket and hat on, entertaining the incoming folks with an acoustic pre show!!!!!! Thus, we got to gear Growing up and This Hard land. 2 hours later, as everything was set for the concert to start, rain started to pour down. I guess Bruce couldn't delay the start for so long and as the band took the stage, he launched into the first line of Who'll stop, and that made my whole day worth it, getting people alive and kicking, forgetting about the rain. Trapped, was a big moment of the first half of the show, with great crowd participation, such as for My Love. Be True is a good rocker, but maybe No Surrender would have been better. In these kinda conditions, with rain pouring down from time to time, the second part of the show turned out to be a big rocking party with Badlands, Out in the Streets, Jungleland, Mary's Place etc\u2026 Bruce looked like he was 25, sliding on his knees across the stage, hanging upside down on his mic, and looking amazed by fans standing in the rain. The encores, starting off with Bobby Jean, and all the waving arms as Bruce waved his guitar were so much fun, going on with a killer Born to Run and a never ending Ramrod. I was expecting the Detroit Medley, but Bruce pulled out another surprise, and this 7 nights To Rock, that was rehearsed, turned out to be very good. The end of the show was close, and as the band launched into Dancing In the Dark with the lights on, nobody really cared anymore about the rain and! I think this was the biggest hit for the people in the stands, who seemed a bit quiet during other songs. For us in front of the stage, it was the last occasion to jump in rhythm with Bruce. So after all, this was yet another great performance by THE man, putting his heart an soul to his job. I got Who'll stop the rain, and my fellow American fan got Jungleland. I have only one French word to teach Bruce : REVIENS!!!!!!! (come back!!!!) I wish the fans attending the upcoming concerts to have a blast, just as we had in Paris. Tramps like us\u2026.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Olivier Rival</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Just to add to the first comment that there was probably much more than 40000 people there Saturday. As the stadium can host 80\u00a0000 people for a soccer game , there was probably 50\u00a0000 people in the stands and more or less 10\u00a0000 more on the field. The show was awesome. It was my fourth Bruce's concert and it was a lot better than the Lyon's concert i saw during the \"reunion tour\" , almost as good as the 1992 Barcelona one! (and i don't know how you can top that one!). All the new songs look a lot better live than in the album. Best song of the night for me was the magic version of Jungleland Bruce gave us .</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Paul Chang</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">What a show! Flew five hours from Perth to Singapore with a 10 hour layover at Singapore airport, then flew to Paris via London (15 hours), met up with my buddy Chris to attend a fantastic show! It was pissing down raining before the show, and I just _knew_ that he was going to play Who'll Stop the Rain as the first song. What a blast that was! The other highlights were Trapped and Be True and of course Seven nights to rock (and seven nights to roll!, whoo hoo!). Never heard this last song before in any form, so it was a real treat for me and for Paris. It rained/poured several times during the concert and my eyeglasses fogged up because of the sweaty and wet people around me in the pit. Thankfully, jumping up and down like an idiot to the music unfogged them. :) I had fun during the rain (got totally soaked) keeping tabs on the songs that had a 'rain' reference in them. These are the ones I can remember: Who'll stop the rain; Mary's place (let it rain\u2026.); Waiting on a sunny day (it's raining, but there ain't a cloud in the sky\u2026); the ties that bind (You sit and wonder just who's gonna stop the rain); Worlds Apart ('Neath Allah's blessed rain); my city of ruins (And the rain is falling down); Bobby Jean (now we went walking in the rain). Just tons of fun. Two other highlights for me: towards the end of the piano solo by Roy during Ramrod, a kid (about 6-7 years old) comes out and puts Roy's hat on his head as he's playing; then during Dancing in the Dark, Jon Landau comes out and plays guitar with a big cheesy grin on his face. Springsteen concerts - a real family affair! FYI: These were the songs we heard during the soundcheck at about 6:00 PM: Does this bus stop/growing up/this hard land.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Marciano</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Vive le Boss It s Boss time! The prospects didn't seem that great. The clouds were dark and rolling, the rain determined, the Stade de France a bit like a prison we were politely waiting to willingly incarcerate ourselves in. While waiting at my gate, the band s soundcheck floats over to us: some tantalizing Telecaster-like chords, a few whacks from the drums, some lovely, ethereal saxophone probably Clarence, demonstrating the versatility and sensitivity that he rarely reveals during shows or on record.<br/>\nThen the band tried out a song a clipped, vigilant intro that I m pretty sure that no one has heard on stage for many years: Trapped , the one edgy diamond in that pool of artificially sweetened self-righteous mush that was We Are the World. Bruce comes in on the verses, but hangs back from the chorus, as if lost for words but more likely just saving his larynx for later. It s a real surprise, but one that, disappointingly, doesn't seem to affect the waiting crowd. In fact, the soundcheck drifts past most of them with almost no noticeable effect, as if they feel somehow only free to lose their sense of containment and show their excitement at the allotted time, ie. showtime. The rest of the soundcheck is the first half of The Rising , Lonesome Day , followed by a couple of runs through what seems until much later to be a pretty routine old rocker, Seven Days to Rock . That s it, apart from a waft of an acoustic, slide-driven Born in the USA , drowned in part by the in-house PA playing a slew of 80\u00a0s soft-rockin' hits, (which is later fortunately replaced by Little Steven s admirably eclectic Underground Garage, even if it is drowned out at regular intervals, this time by apocalyptically crashing adverts played over the stadium s main screen.)<br/>\nAt 6pm, we re in and queuing to be searched. Why by the way do we put up with the ridiculous rule of no plastic bottles (even of water)? It s a scam. I smuggle mine in anyway, my token act of resistance for the day.<br/>\nJust as I begin to run towards the stage to grab myself a fine piece of floor to stand on, I hear Bruce s voice and strummed acoustic chords. A bolt of excitement runs through the new entrees; I enter the stadium to see a sole figure on stage, in black leather jacket, jeans and baseball cap, playing to a crowd of maybe 800 damp but hardcore fans going doolalley with shock and excitement to be witnessing such an event. I pick up as much extra speed as I can on the slippery white plastic surface. First off, I think, it s Does This Bus Stop at 42nd Street , then, after a smile and a Welcome to the early show , it s a singalong a Growin' Up . Lastly, once he s worked out the tuning, the key and the right harmonica, it s a dour and dusty This Hard Land , which only really catches fire at the very last with the stay hard, stay hungry climax, boosted by the crowd s singing. Then, with a toodle-oo (a strangely English farewell which must have bemused both French and US listeners), and See you later , he s gone.<br/>\nIn the crowd, we look at each other in disbelief, me thinking not for the first time during a long night that Springsteen has an extraordinary ability to humanize these cold, corporate spaces, mostly with sheer openness and generosity of spirit. OK, we know that he'll get a king s ransom from these shows, (though to be fair, we don t know how much of that he'll give away eventually), but somehow he zones seemingly effortlessly in on our sense of shared humanity.<br/>\nMaybe the best example of this is the way he deals with the downpours that land on the crowd during the show. First we get the impromptu early show. Then, since the rain starts again just as the crowd takes the stage, we get the predictable but thoroughly right Who'll Stop the Rain , which unites the crowd in its shared adversity, and the crowd with the band. But, for Bruce, there s a problem: the stage is covered, so the band is dry when the crowd on the pitch is soaked. So what does he do? He takes a swig of water, walks to the mic and sprays it explosively into the air above his head. Later, he does the same over Clarence (wearing a very natty suit and fedora-type hat, it has to be said), in mid-solo. And then there are the knee slides down the soaking space below the stage designed for Bruce to do some dancing, meeting and greeting at each side of the stage. (Actually, he did the water sprays and knee slides at an overcast but bone dry show in London the following week, but I like my theory, so I'll leave the examples in all the same.)<br/>\nIt s tremendously affecting, but also shows how the distance between himself and ordinary (working) people must be distressing as well as a challenge to him. But, as elsewhere, a problem, while still containing elements of dishonesty, becomes a source of inspiration.<br/>\nAnyway, less of the sociology and psychoanalysis, what about the show? The Rising and Lonesome Day were carried by the band s conviction and passion, and the crowd seemed genuinely excited to hear them. How the band manages to infuse the same songs with intensity and meaning night after night, year after year, is a constant mystery to me, and the pleasure from seeing them succeed in that is immeasurable. (Having said that, I think Badlands , Promised Land and sorry, but I have to speak this heresy - Born to Run , have worn their tires bald, though the crazed delight they triggered in the Paris crowd showed me that I was pretty much alone in that opinion.)<br/>\nThe Ties That Bind the song that catapults the listener into The River with such a soaring lust for life even in the midst of its lyrical resignation was high on my request list, and a real highlight. But one of the most affirming things about the night which was, I hasten to add, easily as good as the best gigs of my life, ie. the River tour in London and Birmingham back in 1981 was that the highest points for me were the Rising songs. Bruce and Patti harmonizing on Empty Sky and his delicate acoustic picking on that song, the stillness of her wordless Eastern-inflected singing on the intro to the rejuvenated arrangement of Worlds Apart (even if the tape of the Qawwali singers seemed to slow them down during the song s raging instrumental conclusion), the sheer joy and affirmation of Mary s Place , with its Clarence-approved 3 rules of a real house party: One, it s got to be righteous Two, it s got to be righteous and Three you have to get your French ass out of your French seat! (which almost, accidentally I m certain, sounded as if it was heading towards some more serious French-baiting, but was taken well by the locals. In fact, Mary s Place had it all for me deep showband soul, gospel fervor, hilarious pantomime goofing and a barely concealed sense of loss bubbling up through the middle.<br/>\nThe last Rising song of the night My City of Ruins featured the band s backing vocals at their most gorgeous and haunting. The song ended with Roy playing the plaintive dying chords, with Bruce keening heartbreakingly at its very end, the crowd of 50,000 or so absolutely silent until the last note had floated away. That was another wonderful, miraculous aspect of the night the crowd s ability to stay with Bruce every step of a rollercoaster ride from madcap comedy, through the depths of vulnerability, heartbreak and introspection, and back to raucous rock n roll in the space of three or four songs, was unbelievable. There were no Broooce's , no chatting through quiet songs, and only a bit of half-hearted Euro football-style chanting towards the end during the very short wait for encores. Wow, all that sensitivity and yet we still managed to go nuts when the moment called for it. No wonder Bruce dropped to one knee and hit his heart with his fist during one of the band s final bows at the front of the stage.<br/>\nOther highlights? Clarence standing stock still in the centre spotlight after playing his showstopping though sadly never-varied solo on Jungleland , his face a mask of sadness, then Bruce walking up, gently putting his hand on Clarence s shoulder and taking over the spotlight for the final, wrenching lines of the song, using the same understated yet devastating version of the melody to be found on the Live in NYC album. Also, a spectacularly stupid Ramrod , Bruce frozen by the question What time is it? , and only woken by Steve s Vive le Boss It s boss time! , one of the many times when the transparently good time being had by all cracks up the whole crowd and raised the energy a good few notches. Then there was Bruce dissolving into giggles mid-verse after a mysterious altercation stage right during Out in the Street . (It seems that a good test of how spontaneous and genuine the front-of-stage antics are is to look at Garry Tallent's face if he s smiling, it seems much more likely that it s for real, since he s not a performer so much as a player (and playing beautifully as always, may I add.)<br/>\nThe torrential downpour much stronger than the showers that greeted even Waiting on a Sunny Day accompanying Land of Hope and Dreams seems to intensify the experience somehow, leading Bruce to add a line about the rain after a line about a train. A man next to me who could have been in his mid-40\u00a0s, seemed before the show began to be a typically quiet, middle-class Frenchman, but the glow of joy on his face as we shared our excitement was a wondrous thing. Alongside us were two fans in their early twenties who shared my 39-year old s passion for the way Bruce s music and ethos is so bedrock-grounded in that old chestnut how to be good, as well as a sense of community, mutual aid and some sort of battle-scarred triumph over adversity and managing to make that mouthful fun. Never in a 100 years did I expect to get such a feeling of shared euphoria and private intimacy from a Springsteen stadium show. If only this redemptive, healing experience was freely available not in stadiums but on the street corners and in the meeting halls of every one of the world s cities, towns and villages. Me thinks I do dream of a better world.<br/>\nMy new friends and I walk away from the Stade de France, me with a renewed sense of hope for what human nature can achieve, and renewed energy to take on the forces that seek to keep us asleep and/or at war with each other for the sake of their power and profit. We walk through late night Paris raving about the gig, discussing humanity s chances of making a go of things without capitalism, and wondering which bar we will take a drink in.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Geert</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">A lot is already said about this show. We were also at gate A and I still can go crazy about the gates that didn't open properly. So, I missed the acoustic mini-set, my camera ended in a dustbin and we were soaking wet from the rain (we were at 8am at the gate!) But hell, how can someone forget his anger so quick. Bruce and the band came on stage and you already knew that Who'll stop\u2026would be the opening. What happened after this one is one big happy show. It was raining cat and dogs and the harder it rained: the crowd went even more crazy. I think that every last show you've seen is the best\u2026but this one will always be special. Thanks Tim&amp;T to make it possible.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Nicola Ventolini</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Well, me and my girlfriend, we flied to Paris to finally meet the Boss &amp; the E street! When we got off the Metro it started raining! Was it a coincidence, you can t walk away from the price you pay. So, I always said I d do anything for Bruce because his music changed me and my life in a land of hope and dreams. We waited the gates to open for 4 hours, sitting on concrete with Springsteenian people. All of a sudden emotions ran through all my body when during the soundcheck Bruce sang his masterpiece the rising . Keyboard introduced it, than came Bruce s voice, and another dream came true. That dream begun when I first heard one year ago his strongly waited new album, and now it was time to celebrate it. After that, there was a soundcheck of trapped , awesome, and this let us expect for a lot of surprises in the concert to come. I was amazed that people waiting there for hours didn't stop talking and contemplate the soundcheck gift. Anyway, rain stopped and at 6 gates opened. People weren't running as I saw in previous concerts, so I walked too. We were walking to the court when I heard an acoustic version of Darkness on the edge of town . I thought It was an old Tom Joad live on air, but when I turned the corner, Bruce was there waiting for us, with acoustic guitar and harmonica. We got completely crazy and we run in the crowd as close to him as we could. My greatest remorse is that I couldn't find a ticket to the Tom Joad tour, and this was my beautiful reward, thanks Bruce. Sound was perfect, but what amazed me was Bruce s voice, It was perfect, sweet and powerful. The chorus in this hard land was unforgettable, his voice was supreme, a poetry in rainy air. When, our common friend said see you later we all couldn't believe what had just happened to us. Right before Bruce came back with the band, It started raining again, and Bruce found us worn like a mountain expedition. \u2026. and with a perfect sounding guitar, we forgot the rain all singing who'll stop the rain . Bruce could read in our hearts, and he turned the rain in gold. After that, I finally danced and screamed the rising , but I couldn't see Bruce because my glasses were covered in rain drops. Anyway, the crowd was hot, and Lalala chorus of the rising faded into lonesome day . People screamed like praises these songs, I felt like home. After that, we had an unexpected but memorable the ties that bind , where Bruce and the band declared a night of sound perfection. We had no time to think and breath, because we had a marathon through my love will not let you down and Trapped , glorious! Then came romantic time, when Patty and Bruce arose their chorus and gave us contemplation time through you re missing . After that, we jumped and danced, it was a great party, from waiting on a sunny day to Mary s passing through the usual explosive Badlands when we spent more time flying than ever. In my opinion, the best part of the show was Jungleland, where piano left Bruce voice empire, and the band flew perfectly passing from quiet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">J.</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">After a 20 minute delay, Bruce and the band came out with a roaring version of Who'll Stop The Rain, in light of the fact thousands of fans were getting a thorough soaking. Next up was The Rising, the first singalong of the evening. Highlights included the rarities Be True and Trapped as well as an amazing Jungleland - with Clarence Clemons at his best - an extended Mary's Place when Bruce called Clarence the 'centre of the universe as we know it' and Ramrod, arguably one of his worst ever songs which when performed live becomes a tour de force. Predictably it rained again - with Bruce changing the lyrics to Land of Hope and Dreams, adding in 'people are getting wet'. An energetic, lively (Bruce hanging upside down on his mic stand was a high point) and at times highly moving show (acoustic versions of Empty Sky and You're Missing were incredible). After nearly three hours we wanted more and two weeks later we are still raving about the show.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

They came out in pairs as usual, with Bruce coming out at the end. Bruce looked great as usual, perhaps in need of a haircut. Patti was sporting a new look in a blue denim skirt, and when I saw here I instantly thought of MiamiMark. The crowd greeted them eagerly, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that there was no pushing from behind. Perhaps this is because the front row is separated from the stage by a three meter wide area where security guards stalk back and forth, and there is no way to actually touch Bruce form the front row. He doesn't even come down to do the 1000 hand slap or let people play his guitar. Regardless, there was a little pressure on each side, but very little from behind, compared to the pit at Arena shows.<br/>\nThe Rising opened the show, Bruce s solo is a little different than on the album, but otherwise this was familiar territory, as was Lonesome Day. The songs brought back memories from last summer, when the new album was being released and these were new exciting songs, rather than predictable set openers we often take too much for granted. Then we got Ties that Bind, with some nice added touches from Suzi s violin (or is it a fiddle?), and then My Love Will not Let you Down. The Fuse was next, and this would be the only time the band played it over the week, which is really too bad. The song is musically excellent, and it gives Nils a chance to shine, which is even more important now that they've dropped Counting on a Miracle from the set. Sound, where I was standing, seemed to be pretty good. No real complaints there, so hopefully Mr Crystal Cat and other enterprising tapers got a decent recording.<br/>\nThroughout the show, security at the front was very tight. There was clearly someone who was a security chief for Bruce, and maybe half a dozen other guys more temporarily hired in. They seemed very intent on catching anybody they saw taking pictures, and when they spotted someone recording on a camcorder further back, all of a sudden they were all talking into their earpieces and giving one another hand signals. It came across as a little wannabe-Navy-Seals to me. They stood up in front of us in the front rows and at one point in the show a scuffle ensued when one fan reportedly got sick of having his view constantly obstructed by a guard and pushed him away. Not the smartest thing to do perhaps, but security did come across as assholes. Clearly they have a job to do, but there are different ways of doing the job. They certainly seemed more intent on catching people for taking pictures with disposable cameras than they were on making sure everybody in the front was actually safe. But they did have cups of water they distributed to anyone in the front who wanted it. Doing the GA thing at these big shows, it is easy to avoid drinking (so as not to have to pee throughout the show) , but it is important to stay hydrated. A girl in front of me was clearly not feeling well before the show.<br/>\nEmpty Sky and You re Missing are clearly emotional songs for the band, but like much of the Rising material, they don t work as well as they used to. They sound the same as they did last year, but it is still daylight when they are played, and you don t get much of a light show until the encores. The London audience seemed less animated than some of the crowds stateside, but also more respectful and quiet during the slow songs. Empty Sky and You re Missing were both given loud applause at the end, but there was very little audience chatter during them. I looked back to the reserved seating area several times, and while few people were standing up during the rock songs, there seemed to be much less milling around during the slow songs.<br/>\nThe first real highlight of the show for me was Waiting on a Sunny Day. It is just such a great little song, I remember thinking; Summer is finally here! Then I remembered the last time I saw a big Bruce show outdoors, which was my first show back in the summer of 93; and then I thought of the coming summer, and all the stuff I plan to do, and then all the people I ll be leaving behind when I move away from University in the autumn. I've never cried before at a Bruce show, but for some reason this concert would be particularly emotional for me. For the first time that evening, but not the last, I felt the tears on the verge of coming out. Bruce went far out on the wings, getting the crowd to sing along. When I looked at the video screens, I saw Bruce in front of tens of thousands of fans, his mike in the air, and I remember telling myself So maybe this is a bit like it was back in 85 .<br/>\nDarlington County was very fun, it s another great summer song, which deserves to be played a lot for the rest of the tour. Perhaps it was a good idea to give it a short rest after 9/11, but I m very glad it is back in regular circulation now . The setlist had yet to yield any real gems (although I held up my Sandy sign every now and then when I thought Bruce or Danny might be looking), but I'll always remember this concert for the fact that Bruce was clearly having a lot of fun. This was no more evident than during this number; he went out on the wings again, and did a naughty little pelvic grind thing during the we wanna rock all night line and sang the final verse with Nils leaning on the steps that lead down to the ramp at the front. Later examination of the setlist showed that Bruce had originally intended to play either Sherry Darling or Roll of the Dice in this spot, and Darlington had been an audible.<br/>\nThe show continued in a robust vein up through Mary s Place, although the London crowd was in all, less than impressive. During Mary s Place, Bruce tried to coax people in the reserved section out of their seats: It s time for the London Ass Rising . Mary s Place does work better live than on the album, but I can t blame people for being a little confused. One minute Bruce is telling them to turn it up , get out of their seats etc., and introducing the band, and then all of a sudden, he s telling people to quiet down; Shhhhhh shhhhhhh . I've been missing you The song reaches a climax again towards the end, but then he milks it too much, screaming out MEEEEEET ME AT MARY S PLACE as loud, high and drawn out as he can. Like 10th Avenue Freeze Out back in 99-00, this is a song which would definitely benefit from being cut down by a few minutes.<br/>\nAfter Mary s Place, a stand up bass was brought on stage. Meeting Across the River was certainly not a song I expected to see on the stadium tour, but it was certainly most welcome, especially in a setlist which so far had relied a little too much on rehashed reunion tour standards for the non-Rising songs. I don t know how the song was received further back, but from the second row it seemed pretty powerful. It segued naturally enough, into Jungleland. This song would be played far better on subsequent shows, but for now, it was great to hear the original violin intro. Suzi actually played it along with Roy, and then added more violin parts later in the song as well. But Clarence was not having a good day at all, and he made 3 or 4 glaring mistakes throughout his solo. Later in the week, he would play the solo far better, but I remember telling myself at the time that if this is the best he can do these days, I would rather not hear the song at all. It was in short, a painful reminder that the E Street Band is not going to be around forever.<br/>\nInto the Fire was much like Empty Sky/You re Missing in that it was less effective because of the light. If it were played a little later in the set, it might be more effective, it could easily take the My City of Ruins spot in the second encore set, although I doubt Bruce would want to displace or drop that song. After the song, I thought the main set would be over, but Bruce went to change guitars and returned with a harmonica in his hands. We got Thunder Road, which all in all sounds better than it did in the last tour, and makes for a far better set closer than Into the Fire. According to the setlist I read later, this song was an audible, and I m glad Bruce threw it in. Perhaps he figured the crowd wasn't as into the show as he had hoped, and wanted to end on a more impressive note.<br/>\nThe break before the encores gave me some time to reflect. The band is having a lot of fun on stage, and while Clarence is clearly past his peak, the rest of the band are rocking like a well oiled machine. The setlist had seemed a little much like a rehash of the past tour, but some of the pacing problems of last year have definitely been ironed out. All in all, the show had been far more enjoyable than you might think just by looking at the setlist. I hadn't seen the band in over half a year, and was very glad to be seeing them again.<br/>\nThe first song of the encores was Bobby Jean, and though I had heard it live many times already, it fit my somewhat reflective mood perfectly. It made me think of Bruce the band in sort of mortal terms. I think since 99-00 we have sort of taken them for granted. But they clearly won t be around forever and we should appreciate them as best as we can now that we have them. In retrospect, he first encore set was probably my favorite part of the show. Ramrod has been turned up a notch since last year. In its present 10 minute plus state, it is truly the new Quarter to Three. I m not sure when they started this, (they weren't doing it last time they were in Europe), but after Bruce asks what time it is and tells the audience he is going back to the hotel to watch some of your fine English pornographic movies! Is there such a thing? , and after Steve tells him It s Boss Time , the mobile band members form a line and following Bruce, they go offstage, dancing to the music as they go. Then Danny and Max leave, and only Roy is left playing away at his piano for several minutes as a solitary spotlight shines down on him. Eventually the rest of the band sneaks back onstage to finish the song (and on this particular night Bruce playfully put Clarences cowboy hat on Roy s head as he returned to the stage). Amid yet more false endings, exuberant cries of Whoooo and much clowning around, the song winds to its conclusion. It sounds almost wrong to say this, but Born to Run almost sounds like an anticlimax after all this. Ramrod is just such a powerful showstopper that anything which comes after it seems tame in comparison. (It could easily switch places with say, Dancing in the Dark. In fact, it probably should.)<br/>\nIronically enough, for a long time I felt the same way about Born to Run. The post BTR slot has always been a tricky place to fill; Bobby Jean was played after BTR on a few European shows in 99 without much effect. Similarly, BTR had opened the encores at the first show of the 02 tour at the Continental Airlines Arena, rendering Glory Days and Thunder Road almost impotent. As a result BTR has often been most effective closing an encore set. But now people, Bruce has found the song for the job. It turns out that it takes a cover song to get this particular dirty job done. Picture this: Born to Run draws to a close, Bruce strumming his guitar frantically. Ordinarily this would be the end of the encore set, but you can see in his eyes that he isn't done quite yet.<br/>\nSuddenly he springs forward to the mike and you hear him declare; Seven night to rock and I've got seven nights to roll! . The song is an old cover, I don t remember by whom. It fits the present day E Street band like a glove, both loose and fun and also muscular and powerful. I haven t figured out all the words, but in short, it is a raunchy ode to male promiscuity, with Bruce playing the dirty old man, relating the different women he is planning to bed on different night of the week, and the different hotels he is going to do this in. He repeats at least one of the verses once, there are short solos for some of the band members and one false ending. I can see this becoming a tour standard from now on, and while that would leave less space for flexibility in the encores, I think it would be well worth it. Bruce hasn't had a standard cover in his setlist for far too long now, and this one is too good to be played only infrequently.<br/>\nThe second encore was standard fare. Bruce thanked the crowd for their support over the years before playing MCOR, indicating that they (the band) have no plans on quitting after the tour. By this time it was dark outside and MCOR and LOHAD benefited from a full light show. Dancing in the Dark closed the show. The song doesn't do much for me personally in its present version and position as show closer, but it is a song that everybody in the crowd knows and probably sends many people home on a happy and familiar note. I believe the show clocked in at just over 3 hours; about 40 minutes longer than the first shows of the tour back in August. After hanging out in front of the stage with the fans for a short while, it was time to buy an overpriced drink and hot dog, and limp off to start lining up for Tuesday s show.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">John B.</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">The show was fantastic. This was my second time seeing the Boss and the best. First time around he was without his other half, The E Street Band, and no matter how great he is he is just half a show without them. They all performed exceptionally well but I was a little concerned for Clarence. It seemed like he was having a hard time as if he was feeling ill, or maybe it was part of the act. Anyway I came away from that show exhausted. This was partly because I travelled from Scotland at 5am in the morning, walked quite a bit and queued a long time. The other reason was, as my friend said, Bruce is used to performing a 3 hour show and I'm not. :) As for my mate, Sam, he went in not much of a fan and only a little interested but since he was in London he didn't mind accompanying me anyway. He left the show commenting on how good it was and how he would have liked to have learned some of the songs before he went in so he could sing along with the crowd. The show was brilliant but one thing I want to ask of Mr Springstreen is that since I travelled all that way from Scotland to see him that the next time he comes to the UK he visits me in Edinburgh or Glasgow. Maybe a bit cheeky but come on man, please. The last thing I have to say is after seeing the energy that man has, true to the song and like a classic Cadillac, he is Born To Run Forever!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Richard Byatt</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">This was WITHOUT A DOUBT the BEST show I have EVER been to by ANYONE, ANYPLACE, ANYTIME!! Everyone of the E-Street Band was superb - Danny Federici's swirling organ on You're Missing; Clarence's solos; Nil's superb playing; Max so clearly enjoying himself (especially on Seven Nights to Rock); you could hear Gary's bass lines beautifully; Soozie coming forward and playing against the Big Man's sax; Roy still delivering those classic piano riffs; welcome back Patti (we missed you) and Little Steven - winding up the crowd, taking a blistering solo on Badlands. So that just leaves BRUCE - he didn't stop moving from the time he hit the stage 'til the time he disappeared, phenomenal .. and the crowd were with him all the way, hands in the air, singing the songs, doing the call and response. The setlist was perfect - I finally got the Fuse complete with that amazing cut-out of all the instruments to leave Bruce's voice ringing round the stadium. And what a great venue - like a smallish-town-America baseball ground, so intimate and with trees all around. I used to run round the track on school athletics meetings in the '70s, never thought I'd be back for something like this! Great to hear My Love Will Not Let You Down, the show opener from the 2000 tour. Quiet for beautiful versions of Empty Sky and You're Missing. The crowd loved Darlington County and Ramrod, really getting into it, smiles all around. And after the high of Mary's Place the amazing, unexpected Meeting Across The River - just Bruce, Gary on upright bass and Roy's piano - I saw grown men wiping away tears (me included), hearing that song, in England, at Crystal Palace of all places! But as if that wasn't enough . next we get Jungleland and the crowd EXPLODES as we go Into The Fire and finish the first set with a superb Thunder Road. Bruce is so clearly enjoying himself up there - hanging off the mike, 'running' in circles whilst lying on the stage, bouncing up and down, shouting at people in the crowd, swinging his guitar round his back, joking with all the band and just generally hamming it up. I swear sometimes he looked like he hadn't changed over 20 years. And they're back with Bobby Jean and the house lights and floodlights are lighting up the crowd, hands swinging back and forth to the rhythm, thousands of memories of listening to the song over the years. Ramrod, not one of my favorites on record but live it's brilliant, really gets people going and then the extended ending with Roy playing rolling 'honky tonk' piano and the crowd clapping along until Bruce creeps up to put his hat on and then we're going into Born to Run - and if you thought the crowd couldn't get more excited you didn't know nothing! Classic Springsteen - out in the open air on a warm(ish) night. A new one on me, Seven Nights to Rock was fun. Somewhere in all this Bruce told the stands to get their British arses OUT of the seats; said he was tired and was going back to the hotel for some Fish &amp; Chips (and some high-class English pornographic films), heard the chimes of Big Ben and promoted Clarence Clemons as next in line for the throne! Bruce on piano for the start of a beautiful My City of Ruins and then the wonderful Land of Hope and Dreams to get everyone's hands in the air and after almost three hours that looked like the end. The band were down the front, looking at their watches and consulting each other; lots of shaking of heads as we asked for just one more song and they relented (as we knew they would) and we went out with\u2026 Dancing in the Dark. What a night!!! Until the next time.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Paul Watson</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">I won't go over the same ground as the other reviews already here. But I will add that the musicianship in this show was exceptional. There seemed to be a lot more complex piano and guitar work than in the other shows I've seen. Ramrod was a particular highlight in this regard. Sadly, not all of the crowd were really into the show, and Meeting Across the River in particular didn't get the respect I felt it deserved. But perhaps it is inevitable these days that some older songs will pass over the heads of some of the attendees at these bigger shows.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

This is the first time that I have been able to afford to make a trip like this so I can't compare it to any other Springsteen concerts. When you have been looking forward to something so much for so long you begin to think that the reality can't possibly match your expectations. But the concert was better than I dared to hope. I expected but was still awed by the relaxed musical brilliance of everyone on stage. But I was amazed at the way in which Bruce gave himself, completely, to each song. Every song sounded as heartfelt and powerful as if it had just been summoned up in that moment and for that moment and the range of emotions evoked was extraordinary. I guess that Springsteen was in an unusually buoyant mood that night (no 41 Shots or Youngstown and a lot of clowning around) but the thousands of us there experienced that (against the sneering snobbery of the British broadsheets) as life affirming - and not in any trite way, Springsteen has always worked really hard for an earned his happy endings. I have learnt so much from Springsteen over the years. Seeing him lived just confirmed that he is one of very few artists, in any medium, who has consistently wrestled with (and walked with and seduced and fought and listened to and danced with) the things that really matter.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Alasdair Craik</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Radically different set list from last night (1 song less from \"The Rising\" and 9 (yes 9 different songs).

Nils - I don't know if you read this site but we met on Oxford Street (Alasdair from Edinburgh), thank you for taking the time for talking to me, it must be a pain in the arse to be constantly recognised when you are just out having a walk but you were a complete gentleman and I respect you for that as much as I do for your musicianship.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Magnus Lauglo</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">\"Sure enough, Bruce emerged at about 725pm alone with a black 12 string. He went straight into BUSA. He had soundchecked part of it either that day or the day before, so it was no huge surprise, but a nice change anyway. It sounds much like the version we are all familiar with on the LINYC album, but has some very fast strumming at the end. It was nice to hear a different song to open, but I must say Ryancoke is completely right about these acoustic opener. The song does not work very well at all as an opener. Back in 93, Bruce opened with maybe 3 acoustic numbers with Roy, and I think that worked very well. But for whatever reason, the acoustic BUSA is no great opener for an ESB show like this. If Bruce wants to play it, he should do it later in the set, and if he wants to shake up the opening slot, he should feel welcome to use any one of his many rock songs, from No Surrender to FOUTR. But barring that, The Rising works just fine. BUSA was the most political Bruce ever got throughout the show, as on the first night in London, he would hardly speak at all between songs.<br/>\nAfter BUSA, the band came onstage all at the same time, and went into The Rising. The next real surprise of the set was the post Lonesome Day spot, and I was awaiting it eagerly. As the last note of Lonesome Day died down, I made out Max s frantic drumming on the cymbals, and I realized we were in for Candy s Room. This is a great song, and one I hadn t heard live before. It starts very slowly, as Bruce speaks (rather than sings) the first few lines, and I think part of the momentum the band had built up with Lonesome Day was lost. But then the song picked up, the drumming got louder and heavier, and within a few moments the crowd was up and rocking again. By the time Bruce cried out; She says baby if you wanna be wild, you got a lot to learn the pace had been reached again. I don t remember much about the song, most versions sound the same to me anyway. I think maybe Bruce s guitar solo was slower than usual. It was great to hear, and clearly Bruce thought it worked well in this slot, as he kept it there for the next 2 shows. Next up was Prove it, which made a welcome return and then a slow powerful Atlantic City, which chugged along at a relentless constant pace, like a giant locomotive. On the setlist I would see later, it emerged that Atlantic City was a last minute replacement for Darkness.<br/>\nEmpty Sky and You re Missing followed, and were received pretty well, but these songs really belong in an arena show. One thing about the stadiums is that they are inherently less intimate than arenas. Even if you are front row, you are further from Bruce than you would be in an arena, by several meters (over a dozen feet). I met one or two fans who said they actually preferred stadiums because there was very little pushing at the front. But give me an arena any time. I actually think a little bit of pushing only adds to the excitement of being at the front. Immediately after You re Missing ended, the fans at the front began to raggedly singing the Waiting on a Sunny Day riff. Bruce seemed amused by this, but finally said Let me start , before ploughing into the song. Steve is now singing the first chorus. I personally would suggest most humbly that he should keep to singing harmonies and backup. Waiting\u2026 is the first song that sees Bruce come out on the front ramp, which gets him closer ot the fans in front, and also has him running out to the left and right wings. I can see the song being a setlist standard if he ever plays stadiums again on future tours.<br/>\nNext up I think was Sherry Darling. This was an audible, replacing the planned Darlington County (reversing the pattern from the night before). Clearly Bruce was going to mix up the songs for us, he even made some comment to this effect at one point ; Who was here last night? (loud cheering) We re gonna play some different things for you tonight . It was great to hear the song again; it s a happy fun summer song, which should definitely stay in heavy rotation this summer. Steve tackled the short guitar solo - he is being given more solos than before, and later he would also play the short solo on Badlands. Then Clarence did his best on the sax part, but the result was sort of piecemeal. In fact, for those of you who are famailiar with it, it sounded a little like the sax on the Darkness studio outtake version. I don t now if this was on purpose or not. Needless to say, Big Man would shine brighter later on in the week.<br/>\nWorlds Apart followed. As on all four shows I saw this past week, the intro is shorter. Bruce does far less of the wailing and clapping his hands above his head in the beginning, almost as if he s rushing through the song. Like much of the Rising material, the song worked better last year, but in this case Bruce could easily bring it back to its old heights by not rushing through it so much. Nice to see Danny on the accordion though.<br/>\nFollowing a robust Badlands as I had hoped, the band went straight into She s the One. This is a great old song, and I was looking forward to hearing the harmonica solo at the end, which I believe Bruce began doing last autumn. Towards the end of the song, I think Kevin Buell threw him a harp, and Bruce used it to finish the end of the song in grand bluesy fashion, much like his final guitar assault on the live versions of the song from 78. It s a great addition to a live song which has a long tradition of going through musical changes and improvisation.<br/>\nNext up was Mary s Place, during which Bruce once again exhorted the London audience with reserved tickets to get out of their seats. I don t know which night in London got the better crowd, but Bruce saw fit on both nights to try to get people out of their seats. Stadiums are massive, and even the moderately sized Crystal Palace at about 40K made for quite a challenge for the band. At one point during the song, I remember Patti and Clarence did a funny flirty little dance across the stage as Bruce was pacing back and forwards along the front ramp.<br/>\nI was hoping for something other than Jungleland towards the end of the man set. I had waved my Sandy sign at a few points, until an over-zealous security guard told me to put it down. I had also spotted another request sign for the same song behind me, so I was hopeful that we might get it. But not tonight. I heard the opening piano chords to Racing in the Street and was almost as ecstatic as I would have been if he had played my song. This was another Darkness song I had never heard before, it had eluded me even though I caught over a dozen shows on the last tour. Finally he was playing it, and I was right there in the second row. Being slightly shell shocked, I don t remember much about the performance, but I did notice that at the end, when they do that final long musical bit (which I had previously thought of as more or less a piano solo), the whole band, including Clarence were playing, rather than just Roy.<br/>\nThen we got Into the Fire, which is probably Patti s best song, and Thunder Road, which will hopefully stay in the set for the rest of the summer. This was perhaps Clarence s best moment of the night, he held the last note of his solo at the end, and all was right in the world.<br/>\nSo far, the show had been very impressive. Setlist-wise nearly every song that could conceivably have been changed from the night before had changed. This trend continued with the first encore set, which kicked off with quite a surprise; Night. I m not sure this obscure song works so well so late in the show but it was great to hear again, and the crowds in the reserved seating began moving around and generally looking as if they were alive. A rambunctious Ramrod followed, and a young girl (perhaps Bruce s daughter?) sneaked out on stage to put a plastic British policeman s helmet on Roy s head as he played his piano solo.<br/>\nAs BTR drew to a close I was hoping for Detroit Medley, and that s exactly what we got. I had seen part of the medley played as part of light of Day on the last tour, and I had hoped in vain that he might play the medley in Detroit last year. Finally, on my 26th show, and after seeing Bruce live for 10 years, I got the medley, and surely anybody who wasn't up and stomping along to this one must have been physically, or at least emotionally dead. They aren't doing that long instrumental solo anymore, but trust me, it is still great to hear. Again, as with many of the Holy shit, I can t believe I m seeing him play this! type songs, I don t remember much of the performance. But it was wonderful to finally hear live. As he drew to the end of the medley it looked like he might not be done yet. I wondered if he was going to add a fifth song, perhaps I Hear a Train or Travelling Band.<br/>\nBut it seemed the band didn t pick up on this. When he went into Seven Nights (clearly an audible), you could see at least some of the E Streeters were taken completely by surprise. I think I saw Nils frantically changing guitars, and Clarence stood looking dumbfounded and shocked for several seconds, his back bent in what looked like utter exhaustion. What can I say, this is what is must have been like back in the day, when the E Street Band were playing three hours or more every night, and you never really knew when the show would finish. Mercifully for the band, and many in the audience, Seven Nights closed the first encore.<br/>\nThe second encore was standard fare, Bruce thanked the fans again before playing MCOR, which never fails to impress, and a happy looking Jon Landau joined the band onstage for Dancing in the Dark as he had the night before.<br/>\nBruce hit London with two powerful shows. Despite an average at best crowd, the band put a great deal of energy into the sets, and clearly had a lot of fun. The second London show was also had one of those jaw-dropping setlists for those in attendance, and I m sure for those sitting at home following things online. Of the four shows I saw, I think the London gigs had the most energy.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Darren Cooksey</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Vive le Boss It s Boss time! Bruce came out alone with his acoustic guitar just before 1930 hours, and began with the stripped down version Of Born in the USA. Not the opener I was hoping for but he kind of won me over with it. By the way, the sound tonight was perfect, no distortions in the mix at all. Up next was The Rising which had everyone singing along, and they obliged with Lonesome Day too. A really good natured crowd here tonight with a number of Italians in the crowd (One with a sign for Point Blank &amp; Lost in the Flood). Candy's Room seamlessly segued into Prove it All Night, and then the first real surprise of the night\u2026 Atlantic City. The first time he has performed this since Atlantic City, NJ last March. He seemed to point to a sign in the crowd before playing this, however I do not know if it was on the original setlist. Prior to Empty Sky he asked \"Who was here last night?\" and nearly everyone raised their hand! Bruce responded by saying \"Yeah right! Get outta here!\" He then promised some more different songs later in the set. The crowd were very patient for the two Rising ballad's, and exactly the opposite for Sunny Day, as everyone joined in the singing. One of the highlights of the show. A great Sherry Darling followed with Bruce goofing up to his three kids who were sitting at the side of the stage. The rest of the first set continued with World's Apart, an extended Badlands, a welcome rest for Out in the Street as it's replacement She's The One got it's second only airing on this European tour, a fantastic Mary's Place with Bruce gave everything, a welcome Racing in the Street, followed by Into The Fire and Thunder Road. The encores began with a surprise, with Night getting the nod this time. The extended Ramrod complete with the band leaving the stage except for Roy, who is left to tinkle his ivories in the spotlight. During this moment one of Bruce's daughters put a Policeman's helmet on his head!! Very amusing, very\u2026 London! The show rocked out with Born To Run, Detroit Medley and Seven Nights To Rock. Sheer heaven, Bruce does this old Rock 'n' Roll nuggets so well he should do it more often The band have such a good time with this I'm sure it'll be played every night till the tour has finished. A final (too predictable maybe) trio of City Of Ruins, Land of hope &amp; Dreams and Dancing in the Dark completed the set. Next stop, Manchester!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Must rank in the top 3 shows I`ve seen of him (with Birmingham, ` 81) and Sheffield, `88. Excellent show, where he seemed even more upbeat and up for it than in `99 Manchester or Earl`s Court. Though a word to the wise, Bruce\u2026You`re 53 old son, and attempting to hang upside down from the mic stand (and failing gloriously !) is not advisable ! Thanks for trying anyway ! The set list was awesome ! \"Loose Ends\" ! \"Candy`s Room\" ! \"Sandy\" ! \"Meeting Across the River\" ! \"World`s Ap\u2026\" ! Sorry, wait a minute how did that get in there ! What`s more the E Streeters all seemed to be really enjoying themselves on an, incredibly, glorious evening in Manchester ! Even more so than usual !! Their unofficial motto - \"Today, we will be wearing mostly black !\". (It`s the new pink, doncha know !). Good to see that Clarence is intent on dragging the band back to those halcyon days when \"they were a hat wearing band !\". Good on ya Big Man ! One note of minor disappointment. At risk of being dragged unceremoniously through the streets of Asbury Park, naked bar for a Human Touch Tour T-Shirt and an embarrased smile, am I the only person in this cosmos who hancours for the return of the full-band version of Born in the U.S.A. ? I mean there`s only so much sprawling 12 string one can take before developing a nervous twich, know what I mean ? Great on CD, but live I do miss the power and emotion of the band version, even though its probably deemed politically insensitive post - The Bush/Blair Tour of the Middle East 2003 ! Nevertheless, this was a great evening, and it does not surprise me that there is a rumour of the guys playing Baseball stadia in the U.S. as Bruce (charmer that he is\u2026.o.k. creep !) said he`d really liked this Cricket Ground as a venue - even comparing cricket to its inferior (ooh controversial !) trans-atlantic copy, Baseball ! O.K. so I said \"inferior\" not him ! Sue me ! Suffice to say that you`re all in for a great time when Bruce comes stateside, particularly in New Jersey/New York where he seems to pull out all the stops ! Painful ! Enjoy.

But then, all of our family had got tickets for Manchester and I couldn't wait! At London we were very far back so we couldn't see him well. This time we wanted a great standing spot like everybody does. I'd just gone 16\u00a02 days before, ready for my 2nd Springsteen gig. We arrived in Manchester at about 10.00am and we waited for 6 hours for the gates to open. There was me, my girlfriend, my two brothers and their girlfriends and my mum and dad. We were all - what every Springsteen fan likes to think, No1 fans. People were getting frustrated about the system that had been arranged but when the gates opened people were going crazy to get in. I remember racing past loads of older men to get to the front, I lived my dream at 16 years old. Me and my family were all together at the front, not right next to the barrier but a line back and we were close enough to smell the sweat from Bruce and that did it for me. His face was so clear and we were right in line with the microphone. My second gig and we all made the front. After that we all had to wait another 3 hours plus for him to arrive but them 9 hours were definitely worth waiting for. The show was more than what I expected and after 3 hours of waiting at the front i still wasn't prepared for what was about to happen. I am not going to bother telling you how it was the best rock n roll show ever because you should know, it's Bruce Springsteen! Of course it's going to be the best show ever! Even though i felt like i was going to collapse because my feet couldn't take standing, I still never wanted the show to end. Even though I thought to myself after 'I'll never forget this night' after a week I couldn't clearly remember the show. But then i went on to the Glory Days website the other week and their is a picture of Manchester's gig and we are all on it. I looked at them and i re-captured an amazing, memorable night. Every song was a highlight, especially the old, classic Thunder Road! We can only hope now, that he comes back to rock the land of hope and dreams!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Magnus Lauglo</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">We had been debating what he d open with. I was expecting The Rising, Stefano was feeling an acoustic Darkness. Bruce came out alone around 725 again, with his acoustic guitar and went into the same acoustic BUSA he had opened the last show with. I was quite surprised he would repeat the song. Once again it was fun to hear, but it isn't the ideal opening number for a show like this<br/>\nThe band came onstage and next few standard songs saw a relatively tame crowd. The band took a little while to get warmed up, but Lonesome Day had a particularly strong ending, and then they assaulted us with a triple Darkness mini set. Candy's Room and Prove it had been played at the previous show, and I was a little surprised at the duplication here. Doesn't Bruce know that lots of people had been at the shows in London? And as for all the peeps who weren't in London, wouldn't they have been just as happy with any two other songs? Darkness on the Edge of Town was the first change from London show, and I thought it was a little disappointing, as Bruce has gone back to performing it the way he did it on the last tour. He speaks rather than sings the fist part of the verses and has stopped playing the guitar break at a higher pitch. In short, I wasn't being blown away yet.<br/>\nAfter this, Bruce did a funny little stage rap about playing at a cricket field, and started comparing cricket to baseball. I don't remember everything, but the crux was that the only similarity he had figured out, was that in both games the ball is very small and hard, and you don't want it to hit you in the face. It was only a short little stage rap of a minute or two, but he probably spoke more at this point than he had throughout both London shows combined. It was clearly kind of novel to him, and though he wouldn't mention the near cancellation at all over the course of the evening, he would several times make comments about cricket.<br/>\nEmpty Sky and You re Missing were received pretty well by the crowd, which stayed quiet throughout the songs and clapped enthusiastically at the end. Standing a little further back at this show, I noticed the video screens, which worked very well. At such a big venue, they are an absolute must, but someone I spoke to after another show commented that he thought they were set too low to be seen properly from the very back of the pitch. They use a fair amount of superimposing (I think this is the right term), where they mix the image from two cameras in order to get say close ups of Bruce and Patti from different angles on the screen at the same time.<br/>\nWaiting On a Sunny Day once again saw the band and crowd getting into the swing of things. For all the heavy power of the rockers in the early part of the show, the intensity is turned up a notch by this little crowd participation. On this song, and several others throughout the evening, I noticed that the bass was much too loud; the only sound complaint I have from the 4 shows I saw. This problem didn't seem to be corrected until the encores. Bruce is now regularly doing his funny little upside down trick with the mike stand on Waiting and in Manchester he got it wrong and knocked off the mike by accident with his foot, which caused much hilarity on stage and amongst the crowd.<br/>\nTwo Hearts followed with Steve and Bruce almost kissing the mike together. Nice to get a different song from London, but I do think this song was sort of played to death the last time the band toured.<br/>\nThe same cannot be said for the song that followed. The band opened with a few loud booming notes, and it took me a few seconds to figure what they were playing. I believe that Sherry Darling was on the setlist, but Bruce noticed AlsionPaige22's request sign (which she had been displaying from the front row since the London shows) and at the last minute must have decided to make her a very happy Laker that night. We got Loose Ends for what I think was the first time in 2003 and only the second time on the tour.<br/>\nHardly anyone in the crowd knew the song, but people seemed happy enough to rock along with it. It was a booming thunderous version, and Clarence nailed the solo all the way up until just before the end, when he ran out of breath and Roy or Danny played the end. It sounded great, and gave me hope that Bruce was in a request sign honoring mood that night.<br/>\nEileen, sorry you missed your Sherry Darling, bring a sign next time J.<br/>\nThen we got very strong versions of several standard songs, Worlds Apart, Badlands, Out in the Street and Mary's Place. I noticed for the first time that Nils plays some sort of electric banjo at the beginning of Worlds Apart, then shifts to guitar and then banjo again towards the end. Part of the guitar solo at the end of Worlds Apart is very reminiscent of the Murder Inc. solo, and it struck me that this four song sequence, is very much like the centerpiece of the shows last tour. Certainly it seems that Bruce likes playing a fun strung out band intro type song two thirds of the way through the main set. There were some minor sax problems during OITS, but I could tell if it was Clarence or the actual sound system.<br/>\nThere was a lot of clapping from the Manchester crowd, and while it was hard to compare to London, as I was standing much further back, it seemed to me like the audience was overall a little more into the show than the Crystal Palace crowd had been. Still, Bruce tried to get people up from their asses during Mary's Place. It's time for Manchester Ass Rising! C mon I know you can do it! Besides, you gotta be standing up because I am about to introduce to you the members of the legendary E Street Band! Or something to that effect at least. I for one wouldn't mind Mary's Place to be cut down by 5 minutes or so, but this was undeniably a powerful version.<br/>\nAfter Mary's Place a stand up bass as brought onstage and as on the first night in London we got Meeting Across the River. I was quite surprised by this. I had anticipated Jungleland but I expected Meeting to be quite a rarity. It would show up in Dublin as well, so guess Bruce likes it in the pre Jungleland slot. As I remember it, only Bruce, Gary and Roy play on this song, the remaining band members taking a break. Perhaps one of reasons Bruce plays it, is in order to most of give the band a break between Mary's place and Jungleland. Roy especially must get quite a workout! And Bruce of course, but we knew that already. The song was performed to perfection, and marred only by Garry's bass being too high in the mix.<br/>\nMeeting was of course followed by Jungleland, and after Clarence's disappointing performance in London, I was holding my breath to see how the Big Man would hold up. You could tell he was taking short breaths throughout the song in between notes, but he played it note perfect. It gave me a great feeling. He may be past is prime but is clearly far from being on his last legs. Someone noted that on the Reunion tour Clarence was given oxygen after playing the solo, but now he rejuvenates simply by sitting down for the rest of the song. He is certainly not the only one, the show is set up so several band members get go off stage or sit down at various points. Maybe at some point the band will find it fit to do an unplugged and seated tour? (And for the record, I think that could be very exciting musically). I wouldn't be surprised if a future tour is closer to the 86 Bridge benefit than the 99-00 tour.<br/>\nWhen they did Into the Fire I suddenly realized that I hadn't been thinking I wish I were closer to the stage for quite a while. Clearly it is best to be up close, but it isn't as if it is impossible to enjoy a show from further back once you've been in the first few rows.<br/>\nThe main set closer, Thunder Road was dedicated to someone in the audience whose name sounded to me like Oscar Bruce.<br/>\nThe band returned for their first encore, and I was expecting Bobby Jean or some other rock song. But this was most gloriously not to be. The first clue I got was that Bruce didn't plough straight into one of his Awwnn, Two, Three Four count-offs. He had his guitar in its usual position, horizontal and low on the hip and introduced the next song as a request, and he then made contact with some fans several rows back to his right. I had seen some people with a Sandy sign (much bigger than my own, I should mention) in that position in London, could it possibly be ? He made some friendly joke with them something like; I met you and your husband You must have a great husband. Or something like that.<br/>\nAnd then without further ado came what I was hoping for: Sandy I squealed in most unmanly fashion and fell to my knees as he sang; the fireworks are hailing over our little eden tonight . When people around me looked at my strangely, I showed my sign, and I got a friendly pat on the back from someone. Believe me folks, it was a beautiful version. He went straight into the song without any musical intro, but unlike the dry renditions from the last tour, he sang the song instead of speaking it. He sang it with a full voice. It was a happy warm performance with plenty of accordion and the whole band filled in sax and harmonies aplenty. I remember glimpsing Stefano a few meters away. I wanted to make eye contact, but his eyes were closed, with his arms raised to the sky like a man praying. I felt pretty religious myself right then. I don't know how many people in that massive cricket field knew the damn song, but they certainly cheered loud enough when it was finished. I think those 6 or 7 minutes were my favorite moment of the entire week. In retrospect, it meant far more to me than getting second row right in front of Bruce in London, or hearing a certain other Wild and Innocent gem in Dublin. It was in short THE SHIT.<br/>\nSandy put a rosy tinge of the rest of the encores for me. Some people were still seated during BTR, I guess it is inevitable that you can't reach everyone in such a large environment. Ramrod saw Bruce exclaiming Everybody stand back 500 feet and then writhing around on the stage in mock frenzy during Clarences solo. In his joking; It's quitting time bit with Steve, Bruce motioned at his wrist and said I don't believe they play cricket this late Seven Nights to Rock continues to work well in its slot, quite a feat for an unknown song.<br/>\nDuring LOHAD, someone in the crowd set off four small fireworks which erupted above our heads. I for one felt a little nervous. Bruce saw them, and I wasn't sure if he would say anything, as we know he has had quite understandable issues with fireworks at his shows. He finished the song and went into DITD without any comment. Once again, Jon Landau joined the band for the last song. The second encore could really use a little flexibility. DITD gets everyone up and jumping around, but plenty of other songs could do the same, and in truth everything after the mammoth Ramrod sounds like almost a bit of an anticlimax.<br/>\nOnce again, Bruce delivered his usual sermon of faith, strength, hope and love. From the sounds of it, completely the opposite attributes to what Oasis had brought to the city earlier, which almost put a stop to Bruce's show. Hopefully Bruce reinstalled a belief in rock n roll for more than a few of the people of Manchester. As for me, this was my 27th Bruce show, and the biggest one I had ever seen. Even if I d take an arena over a stadium any day, he's proven to me that stadium shows do work, at least in Europe. People around me kept silent during Sandy, and then applauded loudly when it finished. I don't know if I would take that for granted even at the Meadowlands. \"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Darren Cooksey</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Phew! A scorching hot day in sunny Manchester and the show that nearly wasn't clocked in at three hours and 27 songs! A fantastic venue (An English cricket pitch right next to Manchester United F.C. which hosted the European cup final the night before between two Italian teams ). The same opening five as the last show, a little disappointing for regular Bruce fans, but just a minor quibble. Prior to Empty Sky, Bruce greets the crowd and goes 'on' quite a length about cricket and it's similarities to Baseball, being very sarcastic and getting huge laughs from the crowd. He ends by saying \"and those cricket balls are really hard too, so that's the same ( as baseball ) if they hit you in the nuts it really hurts!!\" Not for the first time Patti just shakes her head and smiles. Rock star husbands, who'd have 'em? Prior to 'Sunny Day' the crowd start singing, out of key, the Do Doo refrain, prompting Bruce to say \"no, no wait for the band to start! That's not good!\" Two Hearts, minus the 'it takes two' at the end. Loose Ends- played by request, the band mess up the start (no Roy Bittan, did he know what they were playing??) and Clarence gets his Sax solo wrong! Out in the Steet, such a great out-door concert song. Mary's Place - now even longer! At the start of the first encore Bruce talks about the request he is playing next, and who it is for). 4th Of July Asbury Park, Sandy - no band intro as featured on Live 1975-85, Bruce starts the song from the first lyric. Seven Nights To Rock- highlight of the show! The Band stand in a line and mime whether to play another tune or not, and they take their time working up the crowd!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Kevin Turner</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Bruce and the band seemed to have a really great time tonight. Old Trafford cricket ground generated a good atmosphere, Bruce cracked a few jokes about the similarities between cricket and baseball. The band played really tightly with Mighty Max superb on the drums. Bruce's voice was incredibly strong and I never heard him hit a bum note all night. The whole set was first class with \"Meeting across the River\" being a welcome surprise. They might be getter greyer, balder but the music and performance just keeps getting better and better. Can't wait 'til the next tour - missing you already.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Ian Ockerby</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">what a great night, singing in the pub with other Brucies before the concert, took my 16 year old daughter her first Bruce concert, on our way home she said dad i have been to some concerts with my school friends Westlife, blue, but that has to go down as the most enjoyable night i have ever had my hands are still sore from clapping so much, can we please do that again, when will he be back.it brought a tear to my eye. Bruce your music found my daughter just like it did me all those years ago, i cant thank you enough, your the man. highlight of the night seven nights to rock we just held each other as we sang along, fantastic, hurry up back Bruce my sons approaching his teenage years.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">David Stringer</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Bruce saunders on stage 5 minutes before scheduled, alone and armed with acoustic guitar. The crowd erupts then quiets down for a bluesy rendition of \"Born In The U.S.A\". The band come on and kick into a stomping version of \"The Rising\" sequenced into \"Lonesome Day\". Next up 3 tracks from Darkness. \"candy's Room\", \"Prove It All Night\" and a fantastic \"Darkness On The Edge Of Town\". Bruce is in fine voice. He says we have a nice spot here and jokes about the similarities of baseball and cricket and asks for some quiet for the next few songs, a duet with Patti on \"Empty Sky\" and a beautiful \"You're Missing\". Time for an audience sing along to \"Waitin' On a Sunny Day\" then into \"Two Hearts\" and an unexpected \"loose Ends\", a real gem. \"Worlds Apart\" and into \"Badlands\" were the crowd takes over with the \"Wo wo o o oo oo\", Bruce cracks up as he listens. \"Out In The Street\"(oh oh o o oh) proceeds fantastic \"Mary's Place\" were Bruce gives us the 3 rules for a house party: 1 you've gotta be righteous 2 you gotta be righteous and 3 you gotta get your ass out of your seats! To which we all coax the people in the seats to get their asses up and they oblige as Bruce introduces the band. Great fun. The big bass comes out for \"Meeting Across The River\" and then the holy grail epic that is \"Jungleland\". A haunting version of \"Into The Fire\" makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end as Bruce's voice echoes around the cricket club. Thunder road (my favorite Bruce song) makes the crowd erupt again. Bruce dedicates the next song to a woman who requested it, who follows him around form show to show and he says it's nice to see her husband with her for the first time. The song is \"Sandy\". Wow! Bobby Jean's next then a great extended \"Ramrod\" which sees the band disappearing leaving Roy Bittan doing a bluesy piano solo(Bruce's son creeps up behind him and places a hat on his head as the band rejoin him for some 'Boss Time'. The show wouldn't be complete without the classic \"Born To Run\". Then a really enjoyable cover of\" 7 nights to rock\". For the final encore Bruce sits at the piano. 'So this is cricket?' he asks, to much laughter and thanks everybody for coming to the show and sticking with him all these years then goes into \"My City Of Ruins\", \"Land of Hope And Dreams\" and after teasing the crowd whether to do one more or not a revved up version of \"Dancing In The Dark\". As we walk to the exit with the sound of Bruce hollering a new song via the big screens i know i'll remember this day forever.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Ian Tatlock</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">\"This nearly didn't happen at all. The good people who live around Lancashire's County Cricket ground objected to the granting of a license for this gig, complaining that their gardens were abused by fans urinating, skinning up and shooting up the last time LCCC staged a concert here. The band in question on that occasion? Oasis! Say no more! LCCC successfully appealed, thereby grabbing a little financial security for themselves, claiming that Bruce Springsteen fans were respectable, balding, middle aged professionals who wouldn't dream of dropping a paper tissue in these very nice gardens, let alone an acid tab.<br/>\nBefore we got the tickets for this gig, I felt there were some hard questions to be asked and difficult decisions to be made in deciding whether or not we really wanted to see Bruce at all. It wasn't in any way a cut and dried case. When I saw him doing the River tour in 1981 at Birmingham's NEC, in terms of his recorded and live work, he was very much on top of his game, and in magnificent form, and I had consequently had a great night. Wembley Stadium in '85 was a similarly good show, coming on the back of the Nebraska and Born In The USA albums, and at least in terms of his live work, presented Bruce at the peak of his form. In the early 90's I think he lost the plot, as illustrated by the lacklustre Human Touch, and Lucky Town albums and the gig Chris and I saw with Paul, at the MEN Arena in May '99. So, there wasn't an automatic, resounding 'yes' to be given for attending this. Bruce can have his off periods, but when he's good, he's very good, and how often is it that an artist of his stature plays an open air gig, 20 miles from our house, on a beautiful warm summer's evening, in a setting as pleasant as this? In the States, they'll drive all night to buy a pair of shoes and see this sort of thing. Over here, people will travel from Huddersfield to be able to attend. Sod it! We'll go!!<br/>\nChris had the great idea of driving to Altrincham, then getting the tram to Old Trafford. As is always the case in these type of situations, I was worried about whether our car would still be there when we returned, but I knew that in adopting this strategy, we would at least avoid overpriced car parking and massive queues at the end of the show. So we left the car in a free Altrincham car park, and joined the queue of fans trying to buy a tram ticket from a machine. Whatever happened to human beings? After five minutes we got to the front of the queue, only to discover that we didn't have the right amount of change to buy the tickets we needed, and that our ?10 note was being brusquely refused. We then had to go and get change from elsewhere in the station and queue again, thereby forcing my anxiety levels to rise far too high at a ludicrously early stage of the evening. This threw into question whether or not we should have used the tram at all. I was worried that at this rate the gig would have started before we even arrived. Such controversy!<br/>\nWe eventually get to the ground by about 6.30pm and I have my next stress inducing crisis! As we walk in an officious moustachioed security guard asks me if I have any bottles of drink in my bag. Being an honest type and thinking that he'd search me anyway, I declare that I have one 55p bottle of Evian water. Because the good man says that it could be used as an offensive weapon, I have to hand it over. I complain, but to no avail. The moustache tells me that there is an abundant supply of free water inside the ground, but throughout the whole of the evening that follows, I didn't see a single water vending site or person. When it comes to her turn, Chris tells the man that she has no such hand grenade in her bag, and gets in scott free with her bottle of Evian. Was I bothered? Did I allow such a small, trifling, insignificant incident to get to me? In a word, yes! Did I rise above it? In a word, no! I was incandescent at the petty bureaucracy of it all. This did not bode well. It wasn't even 7.00pm, and the ticket machine and moustache have both tried to conspire to spoil my evening.<br/>\nAs we head for the toilets, Chris works hard to try to calm my fizzing nerves, by trying to be helpful in pointing out where I went wrong with moustache man - \"You shouldn't have opened your bag for him. I didn't.\" Oddly enough, this type of soothing doesn't work very well! I head for the bar - where else? - where a small transparent plastic cup of red wine costs me ?3.80, and a pint of orange juice ?3.00. Had I so desired, as an alternative, I could have had a bottle of champagne for ?40.00, or a bottle of Evian water for ?1.50. I pass on the champers, and decide that\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. WHAT? A BOTTLE OF EVIAN WATER FOR ?1.50. I thought that under the terms of the Geneva convention, bottles of water had been outlawed in here. I considered appealing against this grossly unfair and inconsistent application of policy, but thought that it was time I started to focus on the matter in hand - a Bruce Springsteen gig. C'mon man, this concert isn't an everyday occurrence. I'm in danger of letting these silly things get in the way.<br/>\nBefore we make our way further into the crowd, we check out the ubiquitous merchandise stall. Just as this is probably as an expensive a pair of tickets that Chris and I have ever bought, so the souvenir shop reflects the trend. With mugs at ?7, t-shirts at ?20, key rings at ?4, a printed programme at ?10, and a CD Rom programme at ?13, we graciously decide to pass on all of these very tempting offers. At the folk club gigs I attend by the likes of Martin Simpson, Martin Carthy and Ralph McTell, they supplement their income by selling a significant number of copies of their CD back catalogue from a stall in the foyer. Here, there wasn't a single copy of any of Springsteen's huge back catalogue to be found anywhere. I wondered why that was? However, at a recent Eddi Reader concert, for ?15 it was possible to pre-order an authorised CD bootleg of the show you were about to watch. Now had that offer been available tonight\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026<br/>\nGenerally, I hate large stadium or arena gigs, and after the last time we saw Springsteen at the MEN, I vowed that I wouldn't go to another one. So, to try to minimise the risk of all of the things I hate about these large shows spoiling things, we set about the important task of trying to find a decent spot. As you might guess, I want everything - perfectly mixed CD quality sound, and a cracking close up view very close to the stage. However, that kind of view would probably mean standing in a place where Chris would find it impossible to see. It goes without saying that if I had to choose between the perfect view with amazing sound without Chris; or a naff view and sound with Chris, I'd go for the former\u2026\u2026.er\u2026\u2026. I mean, latter every time. We try a couple of different reasonable spots, and eventually settle for a place about 100 yards from the stage, over to the right, in front of the grand LCCC pavilion.<br/>\nAt 7.25pm, without any fanfare or fuss, the pre-gig tape of sixties hits (Who, Beatles, Move, Byrds et al) suddenly stops and Bruce comes on stage. He looks very serious and solemn, and chooses to commence the proceedings with a slow delta blues version of Born In The USA, played with a bottle neck on his blue Takamine 12 string cutaway guitar. It's a million miles away from the gung-ho version on its eponymous album, to the extent that it's almost unrecognisable. Even though he received a long welcoming ovation for a good few minutes, it's a strange low key way to get things going, and his persona at this stage of the proceedings is a long way from the cheeky chappy joker we get to meet later.<br/>\nOn either side of the stage are a massive pair of screens that project very high quality video images of the on stage action. I try hard to watch the tiny, but recognisable figure of Bruce on the real stage, and attempt to block out the screens and ignore them. If I watch them, it feels like I've paid ?40 to watch telly! In the early stages of the gig, I think I watched the real on stage action, as opposed to the TV, for about 40% of the time, but later on, I think this figure is reduced to about 10% or 15%. By then, I'm justifying watching the screens by thinking I should just enjoy the whole experience and sense of occasion, and if that means watching TV, then just do it! In an ideal world, seeing a band as good as this, playing as well as this, in say the Bridgewater Hall, would be a truly exhilarating, powerful and awesome experience. However, that would mean that even if Springsteen spent the whole of his life just touring small 2000 seater venues like the Apollo, he still wouldn't satisfy the demand. I guess that the arrangement we have tonight, where he plays to 50,000 punters all in one go, is just about as reasonable a compromise as we're going to get. Like it or lump it dude!<br/>\nHaving said that, some of these people try to make it even more difficult for the rest of us to enjoy the magic of The Bruce Springsteen Open Air Live Experience. Some of these idiots seem to be very happy to spend their ?40 so that they can buy very expensive pints of lager and spend their time at the concert guffawing and talking in very loud voices. Now if that's what they want to do, I guess it's their prerogative, but not within my earshot, puuuurrrrrlease. I'd like to listen to the music if that's OK by you old chap. Laughing and shouting like that at a concert like this simply isn't cricket. Where do you think you are - an Oasis gig? If you were to try listening for a change, it would do you a world of good, and I think you may just find that at his best, Mr Springsteen has some interesting things to say about the human condition. Later on, some moron in front of us thought it would be a good idea to wave a large inflatable daffodil which, for me, because of the relative perspectives, completely obscured Bruce and half of the band. For God's sake. An inflatable daffodil! Why don't these people just stay at home. Easy now. I'm getting wound up again. Breathe. Count to ten. Breathe. Count to ten. Breathe. Count to ten. Other than this small minority of socially irresponsible vagrants, the remainder of the audience is made up of your average collection of respectable, balding, middle aged professionals like myself. At what other rock gig would you find a punter who had heeded the section of the ticket that said: \"Warning: It is possible that exposure to loud music may cause damage to hearing,\" so meticulously that she'd pushed a big lump of cotton wool into each ear?!!<br/>\nAs the solo, and unfamiliar version of Born In The USA comes to a close, the other nine members of the E Street Band stroll on stage. It's the familiar line-up of Roy Bittan and Danny Federici on keyboards; Bruce, Steve Van Zandt, Nils Lofgren, and Patti Scialfa on guitars and vocals; Garry Tallent on bass; Max Weinberg playing the drums, and Clarence Clemons the sax. The newcomer is a violinist brought in to replicate some of the string arrangements from The Rising album, and very effectively she does it too. I'm afraid I didn't catch her name. Some clot standing next to me was busy yelling something about Bruce being God - followed by \"whoo\". The band look an odd bunch. Bruce still has a large collection of earrings shared between his ears, a haircut that's a kind a of gypsy mullet, a tiny beard just below his bottom lip, and a pair of long sideburns that can't disguise his 54 year old pock marked face. As ever he's in his working class hero outfit with black jeans, cowboy boots and a dark blue checked lumberjack shirt. Soprano or not, Steve Van Zandt is no oil painting either. I read in a Rolling Stone interview how amused Bruce had been by the fact that up until a couple of years ago, his three young children used to be very frightened by Steve's appearance, and at times tonight, it's easy to see why his bandanna clad head and face would have that effect on the under fives. Clarence still looks enormous; Patti provides the glamour (and Chris thinks little else of any musical worth); while the bespectacled Messrs Bittan, Tallent, Federici and Weinberg wouldn't look out of place in an Independent school staff room - not that they'd have the political naivet? to be found working there. On a couple of occasions during the course of the evening, it occurs to me that Nils is massively under used. A man with his guitar and vocal prowess should be in the spotlight far more often than he actually is. I also wonder whether Clarence sometimes gets a little bored, since the majority of his time is spent playing tambourine, and it's only now and then that he gets to let rip with one of his trademark saxophone solos. I'm sure that the money more than compensates for them both!<br/>\nAs I'm taking all of this in, Bruce swaps his nasty Takamine for a beautiful natural wood Telecaster that just looks gorgeous. I still can't make my mind up whether I prefer the look of Teles or Strats. I keep changing my opinion, but on the balance, tonight, I'll go with the Tele. The day before the gig, I'd been to Manchester with Danny who was wanting to buy a Tele and was looking for a bit of moral support and advice from Denis and I. He ended up actually not buying anything, but that's another story. Suffice to say that he would have been slavering like the clappers at the sight of the Tele Bruce now has over his shoulder.<br/>\nWith the full band now in place, they get down to business and launch into the first couple of what will be nine of the fifteen songs played from the current album. Both The Rising and Lonesome Day sound good, if a little reserved, but things really start to take off when the trilogy of Candy's Room, Prove It All Night, and Darkness On The Edge Of Town, give me a 'hair on the back of the neck' moment for the first of two times tonight! Bruce politely asks for a little bit of quiet during the next two 9/11 related tunes - Empty Sky and You're Missing - and the very respectful crowd duly oblige. The evening's first sing-a-long moment arrives in the form of Waitin' On A Sunny Day, which looks as though it could take over from Glory Days or Hungry Heart in the karaoke stakes. For the first time this evening, Bruce climbs down to a walkway just below the level of the main stage, and parades up and down, successfully encouraging the audience to join him in song. In that same Rolling Stone interview, I read that Bruce now has problems with his knee joints after all of these years of throwing himself about on the stages of the world. Watching his diving actions on this bit of the set makes it easy to see why his rheumatism will be very bad indeed in a few years time. At this point, the video shots of the ecstatic audience taken from behind the band look awe inspiring. It's easy to see why rock stars complain about the end of a show like this, and the difficulties of leaving behind that atmosphere and environment to go back to a lonely hotel room. Two Hearts is followed by Loose Ends, the latter being played for only the second time on this tour so far. Worlds Apart, Badlands, and Out In the Street precede the brilliant Mary's Place.<br/>\nDuring the course of this cleverly extended number, the band are introduced by Bruce, who has adopted the persona and vocal mannerisms of an impassioned sanctified preacher. Clarence is the secretary of the brotherhood and we're told that Steve is from the Ministry of Intelligence. He continues throughout the whole band in this vein until he gets to his wife, when in proclaiming her charms, starts to sing the Fontella Bass hit, 'Rescue Me' to her. \"Rescue me, take me in your arms, rescue me, I want your tender charms\" he coos. She looks embarrassed, turns her back on him, smiles in a coy kind of way, before hurriedly walking away from him. He stops, looks at us all confused, and tells us that this usually works at home!! I thought it funny, but Chris thought it embarrassing. Either way, I suspect it wasn't as spontaneous as we were meant to think.<br/>\nFollowing this extravagant round of introductions, we're back to the glories of the Born To Run album with Meeting Across The River and Jungleland. Bruce is an expert when it comes to designing the perfect set list. Throughout the course of this evening, we are presented with a series of peaks and troughs, as one set of magnificent highs is followed by an adrenaline soothing low. We've just had Meeting Across The River coming right after Mary's Place, and that type of coupling is typical of a succession of pairings which gradually build towards the end of evening climax. The next slow build up starts with Into The Fire and a glorious, thumping version of my all time favourite Springsteen song, Thunder Road. After this, the band leave the stage and we start this game of charades where we plead, 'oh please come back for an more,' and the band dutifully produce the goods. I was pleasantly surprised when they came back for their first set of encores to play a great, uplifting, accordion dominated version of 4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy), but Bruce explained that he'd been asked to do it and was simply acceding to a request. Well that's all right then. Things start to wind down a little with Bobby Jean and Ramrod, and the end of this amazing gig is now starting to come into view.<br/>\nI've been to Springsteen shows in the past where he's spent a fair proportion of the gig preaching from the stage, and I haven't always felt comfortable. Tonight there's hardly any of this, but early on in the proceedings while he's doing his 'nice to be here in Manchester in such a pleasant setting' routine, he has a fairly amusing go at telling us the rules of cricket within a baseball framework, explaining that it's a game with only two bases where the pitcher has to bounce the ball and run, etcetera, etcetera!<br/>\nAs nature provides it's own constantly changing light show, with the sun now set and giving way to semi-darkness, the band leave the stage for the second time at 9.30pm, having played for more or less two hours. On their return they work their way through the second set of encores that include the old rock 'n' roll favourite Seven Nights To Rock, and a few more from Bruce's canon, including Born To Run, My City Of Ruins and an uplifting, moving version of Land Of Hope And Dreams, which ends with a well deserved nod to Curtis Mayfield's People Get Ready. With what appears to be his customary sincerity, he thanks us for our support of his live and recorded music over the years. By this time, Chris and I had started to make our way to the exit, which is as far away from the stage as we could get. The view here was dire. The sound was much as it had been in our original place - sometimes awful and muddy, but at other times fine. For too long tonight, the beautiful piano parts of Roy Bittan were far too low in the mix, and consequently wasted. I'm not sure whether this was to do with poor atmospheric conditions or the inadequacies of the sound man. Either way, it was a shame. Still, all things considered, at least we now knew we hadn't been standing in a bad spot for the vast majority of the evening. Finally, on stage, the band pretend to go through a 'shall we shan't we do another number?' type dilemma, before finally delivering a pretty good version of their 1985 hit, Dancing In The Dark, to bring things to a close.<br/>\nSo the longest gig of the tour so far is finally over, an incredible 3 hours, five minutes and 27 numbers long. Chris and I make our way out to the tram, and back to the car, which was still in one piece where we'd left it. We played Bruce on the CD player on the drive home. You can never have too much Bruce Springsteen. Tonight we saw the future of Rock 'n' Roll, and he's fifty four years old.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Steve Bridge</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">The reviews posted earlier do more than full justice to the concert - it was an absolutely fabulous performance from Bruce the the E Street band - 110% for over three hours - well worth the price of the ticket, and the 'difficulties' with the stewarding, transport arrangements and ticketing. The difficulties of writing a review are that there is so much to say - that hasn't been said before. My own highlights were the combo of Meeting Across the River / Jungleland - even the plain clothes cops in the stand behind us were applauding - whilst listening to their headpieces - what a shift to be on !! Non-Bruce fans won't understand the emotion of the night - getting three out of the four songs I'd wished for - Candy's Room was the other, Racing ITS wasn't - was fantastic, a dream come true. This night will last with me for ever - Bruce is still the future of R&amp;R !!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Alastair Craik</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Back home from London for a quick night's sleep and then off to meet some friends early Thursday a.m. They laugh at me for not taking a jacket or waterproof but as we head south from Edinburgh the weather gets better and better. By the time we reach Manchester its hot &amp; sunny. The show they tried to ban was my third show in 4 days and I was knackered (I wonder how Bruce and the band felt?) but I wasn't going to miss this for the world. To get one show of the quality England has seen this week is fantastic but for 3 shows like this is truly exceptional. If I had to piuck a highlight from Manchester it would be the first encore - Asbury Park 4th July (Sandy) but there were so many wonderful moments all week. Perhaps one of these highlights was Bruce falling off his mike stand when he tried to hang upside down from it - a reminder that he makes mistakes just like us. I just hope they come back soon .</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Annette Ashton</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">What a way to spend a lovely summer evening! You couldn't have got a better early 18th birthday present for my daughter Sarah!

I saw this guy in London but he was only an inch tall. My goodness he's grown.<br/>\nThere he was. A full album collection. A yard-tall collection of Bootlegs. A dozen books. A few videos, official and bootleg. Days-worth of logging onto Greasy Lake. Weeks or even months worth of listening to his music. None of that had prepared me for this. Fantastic! This guy just oozes life and confidence. If aura's were visible then we'd all need shades.<br/>\nIt was funny, I wanted to shout \"I'm here, its me!\" as if you really are the only Bruce fan in the world.<br/>\nA million times on the Lake I'd seen people post \"Oh yes, I was there, and front row too\". I could now hold my head up high and feel I'd now joined a very special club, I'd been to a Bruce concert and been at the front!!<br/>\nSo, here is a review of the show and some thoughts<br/>\nBorn In The U.S.A. (acoustic), I was still stunned by this time.<br/>\nHang on a minute. Have the band had one big argument? They look like a right miserable bunch. Not a single smile. Yeah, Bruce is working hard, really hard. But he's ignoring the band and they him. Patti looks really grim. Oh no. What's gone on here? Very tight performances, but they look so pissed. Crowd are enjoying it but over my shoulder I can see that the seats are on their bums and stories of the lacklustre seating in Crystal Palace means I am thinking - \"Oh God! Bruce is gonna hate us Brits!\". Anyway, LD has finished, what's next?<br/>\nCandy's Room- Goody. I like this one and Smiler really wanted to hear it I heard. That'll get a nice reception in cyberspace.<br/>\nProve It All Night-Great! I fookin' love Prove It! Really wanted to hear it. Smokin' guitar from Bruce but he messed the finale of his solo a bit and Garry and Steve exchange a funny grimace. God, you see so much up close.<br/>\nDarkness On The Edge Of Town-A great solid number. Band are a bit looser. Bruce still working hard but to many in the crowd he is the size of a pea and I don't wonder if this 5-songs-before-saying-hello policy is a good one. Maybe he needs to think about the hello's before the Rising to get everyone involved.<br/>\nYou're Missing- Ahh, Bruce you are forgiven! A funny \"Cricket v Baseball\" skit. He'd done his research noting you could hit the ball anywhere, only two bases, the ball has to bounce (not strictly true but that would be pedantic!), the pitcher actually runs and the ball is hard so \"you don't want to get hit in the nuts\". Patti pulls a funny face at that and they seem to relax and from then on all is well - Bruce is loose after all! Our \"Fookin' love you guy\" tries to get one out from a way away but Bruce is already into his song preparation and he didn't hear him.<br/>\nWaiting On A Sunny Day- The great slow songs are over and Bruce pics up his acoustic from Ned Flanders and suddenly the Italians are singing the tune from \"Sunny Day\" which we Brits pick up in a heartbeat and turn it into a bit of a football chant. Bruce and band are amused. Has this happened before? Great moment. He tells us to shut up and \"this is how it goes\" and starts strumming. Into the song Bruce addresses the seats. He and Clarence have a little skit possibly arranged after Crystal Palace to get everyone up. They do and security run around like maniacs telling everyone to sit down. Bruce tries to climb his mike stand and falls off kicking his mic onto the floor. Very funny. Band laugh. Ice well and truly broken. (He made a big point of doing that right in Dublin ).<br/>\nTwo Hearts- Bit of a surprise which was welcome. The security are really pissing me off now. They are going mental at the use of camera's and are getting really mad at the crowd. I mean come on. Some of these are simple standard camera's and the ticket says no \"professional\" gear. What's the problem? OK, the band do not want to face 50,000 camera's, and having a camera burning a hole in your pocket with Bruce Springsteen 10 yards ahead of you is a little distraction from the show but a little reason please.<br/>\nLoose Ends- A really great moment. Two girls a few feet to my left and on the front row, a brunette and a blonde were really into the show at this point. They knew all the words and were obviously big fans and had got my respect after my first thought was that they just wanted to see Bruce's ass up close! Anyway, Bruce looked into the front row and said \"A request!\". The girls looked at each other and thought 'Can't Be!'. Bruce mouths the song to Steve, Patti, then Roy a couple of times then to Max and the rest of the band. They then tear into Loose Ends. The girls immediately explode into an \"OHHHHHHMYGOD!!! \" moment not seen since Beatlemania. Brilliant. And I'm thinking, that'll get the internet twitching!<br/>\nWorlds Apart- A powerful song that lets the band indulge on some great playing. Clarence is sat down a lot. Is this normal or a new thing? Bless him.<br/>\nBadlands and Out In The Street- Now the party has started. This was great. Can't see the seats getting into it at all though. Can't see how far the madness goes back in the crowd. Doesn't matter, having a great time. Steve is great.<br/>\nMary's Place- While running around Bruce notices the 10 year old child in front of me and waves. I want to shout out that the little bastard pushed in! Then I think that I must have been in Bruce's peripheral vision and somehow that makes me happy. Then I think that I probably need therapy.<br/>\nJungleland- The big bass comes out. Not heard of this before. Meeting starts (its going to have to be a fixture if they have to cart that big thing around) and all I can think of is THEY ARE GOING TO PLAY JUNGLELAND!!! This stops me enjoying Meeting for a bit so I close my eyes and concentrate on the song. Must have looked a bit windswept and interesting because when I open my eyes a few people were glancing at me thinking I must be a HUGE fan or mad. Or both. Jungleland is on and security are bobbing up and down complaining at camera's. Idiots. Anyway, it is a fantastic moment. Clarence gets a lovely round of applause from JaniceUK's side when he replaces his sax. Awwww. This is one of my fave songs ever and I've seen it live. It does not get any better.<br/>\nGod I love Thunder Road.<br/>\n4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)- Another request and I love this song. The people who make requests must feel so special. Well done Bruce. Also, another internet-twitching song. Great set list.<br/>\nBobby Jean- I like this and was glad he played it. I spent more time helping security pass water along to the many thirsty females behind me than dancing but my public needed me.<br/>\nRamrod- He storkes the guitar across the mike stand. Can only mean one thing. I really don't like this song but this performance changed my mind. Seeing the band up close made it worthwhile. Worked well in a stadium setting. Funny how some songs change depending on the setting. However, Ramrod and Bobby Jean in the same show ! Some would see that as unlucky.<br/>\nBorn To Run- 12 yards from Bruce singing Born To Run. If I die today, my life is complete.<br/>\nSeven Nights To Rock- I'd heard of this on the Lake. This was incredible. Really good fun. Monday!\u2026\u2026<br/>\nLand of Hope and Dreams- Nice, renditions but not really encore songs as such IMHO. LOHAD perhaps is encore but I can't get over that naff \"just get on board\" ending. Never mind. After LOHAD I took a picture with my flash. Security went nuts. I ignored him and looked past him. After a few moments stand off he backed off. Idiot.<br/>\nDancing in the Dark- One of the most remarkable changes in Bruce is an acceptance of his legacy and older songs. With the exception of Rosie he will play things like DITD without a problem when before he was in denial about this great great song. I love it. Landau came on stage and he looked like a kid in a toy store. Lets face it, the guy is a fan and he was doing something everyone of us would give anything to do. He played his guitar chord like a kid does who plays the cymbal in the school band. At the end of each bar he gave his guitar a playful stroke and looked like he was having a ball.<br/>\nThe show finished and the band left the stage to great applause. I remember thinking - I hope you guys know how lucky you are and you deserve everything for putting in that performance.<br/>\nIn no time the lights were off and they were taking the stage apart and I was inching along with the thousands to the exits as if it hadn't happened. If only I could reach out for a mental video tape and replay it all again. I only hope some of my pictures came out. Right now my aches and pains were coming back and the traffic and motorway roadworks meant I didn't get home until 1.30am. God, you really suffer being a Bruce fan don't you???<br/>\nI had worried about the show and would it translate to the Stadium. I saw the Wembley Rising show and I was a little concerned. Although I thought it was fantastic show it was a bit Rising-heavy with a couple of (for me) duds like \"Countin' on a Miracle\" and \"The Fuse\" and also faves like \"Incident\" and \"River\" played then were really intimate and low-key, not really stadium stuff. Having seen Manchester I felt it was a much better, tighter and brighter show but the fact I could not see far behind me and the fact the seated fans were not up and dancing was a little worry.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Kevin Turner</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Bruce and the band seemed to have a really great time tonight. Old Trafford cricket ground generated a good atmosphere, Bruce cracked a few jokes about the similarities between cricket and baseball. The band played really tightly with Mighty Max superb on the drums. Bruce's voice was incredibly strong and I never heard him hit a bum note all night. The whole set was first class with \"\"Meeting across the River\"\" being a welcome surprise. They might be getter greyer, balder but the music and performance just keeps getting better and better. Can't wait til the next tour - missing you already.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Rajiv Hasan</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">As the Bruce Man strolled quietly onto stage five minutes before scheduled blast-off, my girlfriend, looking across at the big screen from our angled perch up in block F7, mentioned how tired he looked. Maybe the multi-date tour was beginning to take its toll. Maybe tonight he and the band would just go through the motions, offering us a labour of duty rather than of love. Maybe he was just getting old! We really should have known better\u2026 There can surely have been very few performing artists who have given so much of themselves to their audience, and, true to his 'contract of communion' ethos, Bruce Springsteen and his wonderful E-Street Band gave us everything, and a little more. If there were bags under the Boss's eyes at the beginning of the evening, by the end, he had well and truly burned them off into the warm Manchester night, with a blistering, rejuvenating performance of rock, soul and aching ballads that held 50,000 people in awe for over three hours. We were in the 'must remain seated at all times' area. Fair enough - for safety reasons - but you just knew that people would have to get up and shake it loose at some point in the evening, especially when invoked to do so by the man on stage! The stewards weren't happy about it , but there was safety in numbers and anyway, we only got up a couple of times, unlike the poor drunken lad to our left, who looked like he was going to jump for glory at any moment. A couple of whingeing apes (sat directly behind us, of course!) did their best to spoil things by grunting out their mindless guff through the quiet songs, but generally, people were well-behaved and loving every minute. Highlights were many for me. I'd been singing along to Loose Ends in the car on the way up from Nottingham a couple of hours earlier, so to hear it live (despite Clarence's little mishap on the sax solo) was pure joy. The Rising tracks are so much better live than on the record, especially Empty Sky, which begins now with the sweetest of harmonies between Bruce and Patti. Waitin' on a Sunny Day has also already assumed classic status as THE singalong song (the new Hungry Heart, maybe). Personally, I still can't quite get into Lonesome Day, and Mary's Place could be equally uplifting if it were about 3 minutes shorter. You're Missing is a spine-chiller and My City of Ruins bleeds with beauty. In short, the band and Bruce were as good, as committed and as life-enhancing as the first time I saw them, at the Stadio Communale inTurin in 1988. They can't go on forever, so catch them while you can. Manchester won't forget this night in a hurry.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Bruce came out at 7:25 on the dot - almost imperceptibly given the fact that the sun was still shining and there were no lights to dim. He opened with an almost angry acoustic version of Born in the USA, and for the first four or five songs, he had a sullen look. It almost looked like he was pissed off about something, but that look and that mood changed quickly and boy what a show they put on. A few observations: Tough to keep a dry eye during \"You're Missing\" and \"Empty Sky\" \u2026 unlike in the US, very few people, if any, took the \"Patty Sets\" to re-fill their beer or to dash to the bathrooms\u2026 Great Irish banter by Bruce in trying to get the people in the stands up off their big \"Irish Arses\"\u2026 Bruce and Stevie hamming during the encores with Bruce continually asking Stevie toward the end of each song \"Stevie, has the sun gone down over there yet\", and Stevie looking for the crowd's input, only to say no to the Boss and the show continues\u2026 Great crowd, great enthusiasm.. It looked as if Bruce had a little moisture in his own eyes as he sand \"Into the Fire\".. another moving moment filled with few dry eyes in the crowd..</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Magnus Lauglo</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Bruce came onstage before 730, again with his acoustic 12 string, and went into the acoustic BUSA for the third time running. Perhaps he is trying to make some sort of political statement of sorts? Candy's Room also made its third appearance in a row, right after Lonesome Day. My Love Will not Let you Down and Atlantic City followed, both in very powerful versions which I am sure topped the London performances of those songs. I noticed that Nils had a mini solo towards the end of Atlantic City, it would be great if he were given time to expand this. One of the things I really liked about the 92-93 versions of this song was the long guitar solo which finished it. In Dublin, the end of the song had Bruce relentlessly repeating the; Meet me tonight in Atlantic City line again and again. With four shows in six days, he must have been tired, but it didn't show in his voice at all. In fact, I think perhaps Dublin got a more powerful performance of the early part of the show than the shows in England did.<br/>\nThe opening stages of the show covered familiar territory to those of us who had seen the UK gigs. Although the Dublin crowd was overall better than London and possibly also Manchester (this venue was smaller than both of those), I thought there was less energy throughout the show coming from the people at the very foot of the stage. Perhaps this was because many of them had seen the most recent shows and were hoping for less setlist overlap (I know I was). The crowd was getting quite into the show, but I felt Bruce's performance lacked the same fresh spark which had made the first London show so fun. Conversely Steve and especially Patti were very animated thoughout the show, Patti seemed to be having lots of fun performing with her kids just a few meters away to her left. The setlist would offer no real surprises until the encores, which I thought was quite a missed opportunity, considering how well the audience was receiving it all.<br/>\nPerhaps Bruce had been a little thrown by an event early in the show, when two fans in the front row had made it over the barricade at the front, and were promptly manhandled quite viciously by security, as they were taken away. The security guards were well within their rights to carry the two individuals away, but I thought the chokeholds I saw them employ were unnecessary. I didn't see ho wit all started, but it looked to me like overkill. I hope the two men were not beaten up further after they had been taken away, but who is to know? In all fairness I should add that aside from this unfortunate and unflattering incident, the security guards by the stage (whom all looked like extras from Braveheart) were on the whole laid back and borderline friendly, compared to the ones in London.<br/>\nDuring Empty Sky, I could hear the crowd singing along for part of the song which was very moving. And during You re Missing I noticed that the usually stonefaced security chief allowed a young child who was being held up in the second row, to come over the barrier and sit down for a while, which was a kind gesture.<br/>\nThen followed several standard songs. I don't remember much about them in particular, but I did notice by comparing Bruce and Steve's solos during Worlds Apart, that Bruce's guitar was turned up much louder than Steve s. At one point, Bruce asked a fan to put down a sign, possibly because it was being held up continuously and blocking the view for those behind. As always, it was a real thrill when Bruce came down along the front ramp, singing Waiting on a Sunny Day and Promised Land. He sang a verse or two almost right in front of me. Throughout the show he grins and points at fans he recognises in the front rows.<br/>\nAfter Badlands, I sensed that Bruce waited until the last moment to decide what song to play next. I was sure I saw him mouthing She's the One to Steve, but he went into Out into the Street. The two songs seem to be used alternately these days. Of the two, I think OITS works best in that slot and may get the crowd more excited, but She's the One is to me by far the better song.<br/>\nBruce must like Meeting Across the River as an intro to Jungleland, as he used it for a third time running. Setlist-wise, I would personally have preferred to hear something else, but on the other hand, this was a terrific performance of Meeting and definitely a better Jungleland than the ones earlier in the week had been. Gone were the loud bass sound problems of Manchester, and Clarence was in better form (throughout the whole show in fact) than he had been in England. It is great to finally have the violin back for the song, and Bruce gave a terrific vocal performance with his mournful cries at the end.<br/>\nThunder Road was great as usual and saw Bruce go over to the side of the stage to let a child (his other son?) sitting in the wings play briefly on his guitar. I think it was at this show (but it could have been Manchester) that the audience at the front continued to sing the melody of the Thunder Road sax solo after the band had left the stage, and possibly up until they returned for the first encore.<br/>\nThe band returned for the encores. Judging from the setlist I saw later, Bruce had planned to play Bobby Jean, but he had clearly decided at some point instead to shake things up a little for the diehards, which to be honest I think we deserved. He dedicated it to a fan standing to my right, who Had taken his the bedsheets from his hotel room . I craned my head around to see what it said on the request signs to my right. There was one for Hungry Heart and another which just read Kitty . I held my breath. Bruce joked about possibly screwing up the song because they hardly ever played it, and then they launched into . Kitty's Back.<br/>\nTwo nights earlier, after we had been blown away by Sandy in Manchester, I had joked with my friend Stefano; Well you never know, maybe we ll be talking about seeing Kitty's Back after the Dublin show. It wasn't even wishful thinking, it was meant as a optimistic joke. I mean lightning isn't supposed to strike twice is it? But here we were, only meters away from Bruce as he cranked out yet another gem from Wild and Innocent. I doubt that many people in the RDS knew the song, but it marked the time for select individuals in the front rows to go absolutely mad. Several band members got their own short solos, including Nils on acoustic guitar. I don't remember much about the performance except that it was great. It could have been loose, it could have been tight, but it certainly wasn't in any way slapdash.. I don't remember, as I was going quite crazy. So now I've heard Kitty's Back live! I can't wait for the bootleg.<br/>\nAfter this; Time to Roadhouse and in due time Steve lead us through the now familiar Boss Time call and response thing. Bruce has clearly learned to deal with the nickname he used to shy away from. After all, in certain contexts The Boss is quite descriptive of him. When used on his own terms he is clearly quite comfortable with using it these days. During this song, Someone put a funny Guiness hat on Roy's head which had been thrown up from the crowd earlier. Bruce made some comment to Steve along the lines of; I m going back to the hotel and having some of that black beer that makes you feel like you weight 500 pounds!<br/>\nThe encores were gloriously wild and did not see the band at their tightest. The band screwed up the transition between Ramrod and BTR, and the version of Seven Nights to Rock was quite ragged, with Bruce missing parts of lines. Minor quibbles in truth, these only added to the element of pandemonium which should rightfully be part of any Springsteen show. After Seven Nights to Rock, the band surprised us with an impromptu Glory Days which ended teh encore on a familiar and raucous note.<br/>\nThe second encore offered no real surprises. Unlike at the UK shows, Jon Landau did not appear onstage for the grand finale of Dancing in the Dark. My City of Ruins remains stunning and is one of the few Rising songs which works as well now as it did during last year's arena tour (the other obvious one being Waiting on a Sunny Day).<br/>\nAs many fans have noticed, Bruce tends to introduce LoHaD with This is Land of Hope and Dreams . I m not quite sure why he does this, certainly by now many people in the crowd know the song from LINYC or a previous concert. But to me it works well, in the sense that he isn't only introducing the song. To me he is also giving a summary statement of the evening. He's just been singing to us for almost three hours about hopes and dreams, so the statement is a sort of summary of the concert he has just played as well as an introduction to the penultimate song. I m not sure if Bruce means it this way, but as I stood exhausted ready for the final few songs of the evening (or in this case the week), it made perfect sense to me.<br/>\nGreasy Lakers reconvened at a nearby hotel after the show for some Guiness and a bite to eat. It was nice meeting you all; people I had meet before as well as Frenchie Boy, his cute French girlfriend, and several other fans who may or may not swim in the lake. I regret having to retire before some of you guys, but I was fucking knackered.<br/>\nThe week has been a great one, and I will remember it forever as an intense week-long experience, rather than four individual concerts. It was great to meet so many great fans on the road, and put faces to some of the names here at Greasy Lake. Although I have physically recovered from my week following Bruce around, I am psychologically still up on a cloud of sorts.<br/>\nThe Dublin show was a day before the tenth anniversary of my first ever Bruce show, which I saw in Oslo back in 93. The next Bruce show I see will be in 2 weeks time, in that same city. I m quite glad to have a break. By the end of the week I had noticed that I was enjoying the shows a little less, perhaps due to overexposure more than anything else. Several fans I spoke to thought that Dublin was the best of the bunch, but for me personally, the shows I had most fun at were in London. I m still debating whether or not to go for Milano, but I m very much looking forward to Oslo and Gothenburg. If you re still reading this, thanks for bearing with me. I m looking forward to seeing some of you guys up the road this summer. \"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Jackie Quinn</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">I'm 19 years old, 2 years ago my 24 year old brother introduced me to songs that would change my music interests forever\u2026. I always knew who Bruce Springsteen was (who doesn't know BUSA!!!) but had never really heard anything else. In 99 my brothers went to see him in the RDS but i passed claiming i wouldn't enjoy it cause i didn't know the lyrics to his songs, i mean, how boring is it to have to stand there and not be able to sing along? I wasn't of the same mind after seeing LINYC and particularly If I Should Fall Behind. When i heard tickets were on sale i jumped at the chance to go!! We turned the corner towards the RDS and as myself and a friend got a glimpse of the stage we were squealing with delight\u2026 I couldn't wait! But of course I had to, we listened while he went through his soundcheck which greatly excited me and my brother and then we were inside. There were 3 kids onstage before the show started and I was surprised to find they were Bruce's kids. Then out came the Boss\u2026 A chorus of \"\"BRUUUUUCE\"\" and he launched into BUSA acoustic, I was hoping for Rock version but was sooo happy to see him i didn't care!! The next 2 hours were a whirlwind of dancing singing the bits I knew and just enjoying the view(he looks fantastic for 53!!!!!) then along came some faves; DITD, Jungleland, BTR and ever emotional You're Missing and Empty Sky, was captured by him and the emotion emanating from him as he felt the obvious pain once more of 9 /11 . Then came Kitty's Back, never heard of it before but my bro was extremely excited by this, Seven Nights to Rock was classic fluff Rock and Roll to perfection we had so much fun dancing to it and knew the words almost immediately coz they are so simple! The mistake going from Ramrod was brilliant as he just laughed and said \"This was how it should've been!\" My favorite moment had to be Ramrod, I LOVE that song sooo much!!! and OITS was classic as the crowd just kept singing after the band left the stage!!! My only disappointment from the show was that it had to end and that it did\u2026. He waited for the sun to go down and when it did we all danced in the dark! BRILLIANT show, feel so lucky to experience it\u2026 might see you in USA Bruce if I'm lucky!! must apologize to the poor girl who had me jumping all over her during the really rocking songs, she was so cool, just kept telling me to keep on dancing!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Michael Collins</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">I'm just back in the states after one of the most exciting Bruce moments of my life in Dublin. This was my 51st show (Crystal Palace two was #50). I had my cousin and her boyfriend come over from County Kerry. It was their first show. To see Bruce in Dublin with my deep Irish roots would have been a thrill under any circumstances but this was right over the top. The energy level was like time had melted away. I clocked the show at 3:14. Even songs that have been played at every show (Mary's Place) had renewed energy. The \"pitch\", as they call the floor overseas was packed but everyone was respectful and really into it. Bruce played the Irish angle all night long and the fact that it was still light well into the encores was also reason to add fuel to the Bruce fire. This was one of those moments that will never be forgotten.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Roberto Sasso</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Last Saturday I was in Dublin, for the fifth show of my mini European tour (previous stops were Barcelona, Paris and London). It was an unbelievable night for me: during Thunder Road I was holding a sign for KITTY (made of five sheets of paper attached together), Bruce read it and nodded. After the main set, Bruce walked out and said: \"We don't do this often, but we're playing it tonight for the guy who obviously must have stolen the blank sheets from the hotel\". I was shocked, this jewel hadn't been played in Europe since 1975\u2026 Bruce looked towards me asking \"where are you from?\"; my friends in the front row replied \"Italyyyy\", then Bruce said something like \"I should've guessed it\" (I'm not sure about it). He pretended not to be sure about playing Kitty's Back, then finally started the song, and it was great! There were no horns but the performance was perfect, featuring also a great acoustic solo by Nils. The emotions for me were not over: during the Ramrod reprise, Roy wore the Guinness hat I had thrown Bruce earlier (during Out In The Street).

Unfortunately this would also be the last concert for me to see from this tour. The day was really hot, but I can tell you the evening was even hotter. When I arrived at 10:30 there were quite some fans already there. We spent the day waiting for the gates to open and at about 6:00 p.m. they did. Two hours later, Bruce finally entered stage and opened up with a terrific acoustic version of Born in the USA. The band joined him and The Rising, Lonesome Day, Jackson Cage (what a nice surprise), The ties that bind and My love will not let you down put everyone in a good rocking mood. Empty Sky and You're missing gave us time to breath and then it went on rocking the house. It was a well-done mixture between old and new songs, so I guess everybody should have enjoyed it. As far as I can judge it, Bruce enjoyed himself too. He was running up and down the stage, jumping onto the piano and sliding on his knees along the stage. The main set closed with Tenth Avenue freeze-out, one of my favorites. Of course he didn't leave by then, but came back for some more songs like Bobby Jean, Ramrod, Born to run, Seven nights to rock and finally Dancing in the Dark. This was the last song and after about 3 hours of great rock'n'roll music I was really done, but happy. Thank you for a fantastic evening. Hope to see you again soon!!!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Unfortunately it started raining right in the moment, when Bruce entered the stage and opened a real high energy show with acoustic Born In The USA . But fortunately the continuous rainfall through almost three hours could not stop the enthusiasm in the crowd. The audience participation was very impressive the whole time. All over the floor the people waved, sang and danced - The setlist in contrast to Gelsenkirchen - included many highlights for both first-time-visitors and Brucetramps. Hamburg got plenty of my own favorites such as Atlantic City,\" The Ties That Bind , My Love Will Not Let You Down , \"You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch),\" \"Racing in the Street (wow!),\" \"Tenth Avenue Freeze-out (original version),\" and new Seven Nights to Rock . Only Hungry Heart was performed together with BAP's Wolfgang Niedecken, which is definitely not my cup of tea. Of course it is rather impossible, to meet everybody's personal preference. Now I like to end by saying, that I enjoyed The-Rising-Tour not only as great rock 'n roll entertainment. Bruce and his band always set a new fire in my mind for more staying power and creativity for my own daily life and business.

The band was awesome and the crowd did a good job of doing what was asked of them. Last nights concert was the 4th. time I have seen Bruce Springsteen live, and he just gets better!!!. I had seats instead of standing but the seats were great, We saw the band arrive and were the first of 46ooo people to greet them, and Bruce rewarded us for that the whole night. We Were the last to see them when they got into their cars, and Bruce gave us one last wave as the van pulled out !! Were he gets the energy to do this night after night after night I don\u2018t know, but am just truly grateful that he finds it. I thought that he couldn`t top Stockholm 4 years ago but I was wrong. Last night he didn`t put one foot wrong. He looked like he had a great time and he gave us an extra encore- he played Glory Days as the last song. If I had to give one negative comment it will be that I were a bit distracted by the people who continually went to and from their seats to buy beer og go to the bathroom because they drank so much beer. Most of us came to see and hear Bruce and not to drink beer !!!! I hope that Copenhagen will once again or maybe even more times have the pleasure of seeing Bruce live, because there is no band or artist alive that can outdo him. He is the best and he comes across as someone who enjoys what he does and not just do it for the money. He understands that he is much more than just an artist for us. He is in my opinion the only artist who can deliver every time.

The best I\u2019ve ever seen (Unfortunately I missed the BITUSA shows and jumped on the train in '87, and haven't missed a tour since then, except the GOTJ). The weather was with us this time, perfect temperature, not too many dehydrated people. Started late, 20:15, apparently in a good mood, and stopped at 23:20 with an extra encore after \"Dancing\u2026\", namely Glory Days. I was almost crying at that point. Highlights: Too many to mention, but Point Blank gave me the thrills. I have never heard it live before. During You're Missing he looked very emotional, as did Big Man. Low points: The sound in the first 30 minutes sucked. And people couldn't shut the f\u2026 up during the slow songs like You're Missing, Point Blank a.o. Thank you MTV! I don't think I will see Bruce like this again, as his band is getting older, and I think it will be physically impossible to keep this pace in 3-4 years. By the way, I had made a request to hear Jersey Girl for my girlfriend, promising Bruce to propose to her right there during the song. Well, he didn't play it, but I proposed to her anyway at 4:00 Sunday morning on a train station in Jutland, and guess what: She said yes.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Roland Christiansen</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Once again, I'm completely impressed by Bruce and the band. What a show they delivered this fantastic Saturday night in Copenhagen's \"Parken\". The second best concert I've experienced with Bruch. Only beat by The Tunnel of Love concert in Copenhagen back in 1988. Especially, I enjoyed \"Point Blank\". This fantastic piece of music from \"The River\" album is not heard so often. What a night yesterday i Copenhagen. Wish I could turn back time!!! \"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Christina</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Just wanted to join in with a few comments from my second out of 3 shows on this tour. Last night was very special to me. Most of all because I was standing close to the stage and still had lots of space to move and dance around on. Since I'm a small person its not very often that I can follow everything on the stage without looking on the big screens on the sides but this time I didn't have to. From where I/we were standing I could see the hole show up close. and I have to say that it was fantastic. The energy that comes from there is amazing. Bruce is so filled with energy the hole night and its contagious. My favorite (surprise) at this concert was TAKE EM AS THEY COME. I have listened to that song so much from the moment I got TRACKS. But I have to say I'm still missing BACK IN YOUR ARMS or DOWNBOUND TRAIN but maybe he will play that in Gothenburg next Saturday???!!! I hope so. I'm not sure abt my favorite at this concert. I always scream at the top off my voice to Badlands\u2026.. but then again all the songs from THE RISING are pretty damn good as well. Glory days at the end was perfect. Denmark I guess must have been an awesome audience. Other than that I have to admit I was also surprised how many people at the concert last night that was so hammered that they did things to people that you just couldn't believe. I have always \"felt\" Bruce fans wasn't like that at all but apparently I was wrong. I honestly think that they shouldn't have sold beer inside the stadium. But lucky me from where I was standing everybody was concentrating on the stage I just heard stories from other fans from around the stadium. I almost cant wait until the next concert next weekend. But still if we are such a good audience why cant we get 2 nights in a row or at least 2 nights in CPH on the tour?? But again my night was just great and today too. The memories just don't go away so easily.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Carsten S\u00f6rensen</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">When words grow small and dull\u2026 but you have to speak them anyway\u2026 On June 14th, I had a visit from an old friend of mine, or so it seemed to me, and I think maybe 45999 others. That's part of the magic of a Bruce show, he is talking to you all the way. It was my 4th show, and Bruce just keeps getting better. Though this time around was a little different for me, I actually got to see Bruce close up, after standing waiting at his hotel until my feet hurt like hell, but the will was strung, and then it was all worth the while, for that brief moment in time\u2026 I swear he looked at me\u2026 only 2\u00a0m away\u2026I didn't get to say anything, kinda dumbfounded, but in my head and heart I shook his hand and thanked him man to man. Later on the show was almost to great for words. I brought along my beautiful niece and my best friend for their first ride on Bruce's rollercoaster of hope, dreams and just plain everything worth while. We danced and sang the night away\u2026 and so did all\u2026 and suddenly he announced one of my absolute favorites, \"Point Blank\" from the River-album\u2026and that's when I knew for sure\u2026 nothing could be better than this\u2026. Here is my thanks to you Bruce\u2026 thanks for all the thrills down my spine\u2026thanks for talking to my heart\u2026 for putting that smile on my face, bringing that tear to my eye\u2026 like you sang \"It's alright to have a good time\"\u2026 let them do their talk\u2026 and walk their walk\u2026 there is only one Boss\u2026 thanks Boss\u2026 though hoping for that autograph next time around. To all you, who weren't the lucky ones, at the right place, that magic night in June\u2026be sad..be very very sad.. Nobody does it better\u2026Bruce is still rock 'n rolls \"capo de tutti capi\". That's it\u2026</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Peter Andersen</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">The Boss came and did the job and did so well. I was a tad skeptical on how \"the Rising\" songs would work in a big arena, but my fears were not justified. The E street band played like they invented Rock N Roll and gave power and strength to the new songs. I thought some of the silent moments of the concert were the best, Point Blank and Into the fire showed how utter brilliant Springsteen really can be with the vocals. And the last hour of non stop party (including a perfect version of \"land of hope and dreams\") just left you spinning brilliant!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Hella</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">The most fantastic concert I have ever seen and heard. The band is awesome. Bruce is the best performer alive. Thanks for sharing these moments with your fans around the world. We love your energy and commitment. I cried, sang, shouted, danced the night away and went through all emotions. Thank you Bruce and the E Street band.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Thue Svaneberg</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Great show! A lot better than the \"Who'll stop the rain-show\" (no one did!) in 1999. Good mix of old classics and The Rising-material. Waitin' On a Sunny Day is a superb live song. Who is not cheerful after this? Empty Sky and You're Missing makes Goose-bumps all over! But when Bruce chooses to play Point Blank (tour premiere) by request picking that from a lot of other requests you can't stop shivering. 1st encore started with Darlington County with Bruce clapping his Fender as the text goes \"Seen Wayne handcuffed to the FENDER (!) of a state trooper's Ford\". During Ramrod, a true rock shaker, the band leaves stage, but leaving Roy Bittan behind doing a 2-minute piano solo. GREAT. Someone (his wife?) feels sorry for The Professor and goes to stage and puts Clarence's BIG hat on his bold head. I never heard Seven Nights to Rock live before but what an experience. Pure Rock 'n Roll with Bruce's brother in law guest performing on guitar. Great song and a nice gesture. As we approach the end listening to Land of Hope and Dreams expecting Dancing in the Dark to finish the show Bruce surprises the crow and plays a fantastic version of Glory Days. Seeing Bruce for the 6th time and this time with all my best friends this conclusion of a fantastic 3 hours and 7 minutes show will pass on to history!\"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Jan Olav</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">First of all, let's make one thing clear: My very first Bruce show, and was it as great as expected\u2026. No, it was a 1000 times better! I had the time of my life in that stadium last Saturday Night! To be honest I don't know any words to describe the feeling I got once inside the stadium, seeing the scene, the instruments and stuff\u2026 WOW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>\nMe and my buddy arrived at Parken around 17:05 that afternoon, weather was looking good, and people everywhere around the stadium was getting in mood! We had GA tics and it took us a while to find the right gates, but after a little walk we found it, and lined up. The gates opened at 18.00 and we felt the rush starting - to get in ASAP, and get the best possible places! After checking in we headed for the bathroom one last time (to make sure we wouldn't have to leave during the concert). Next: a beer and some popcorn!. Due to the fact that we actually arrived pretty late we came very close to the stage I think, and almost in the middle, between Patti &amp; Stevie. we had a great overview, and everything looked perfect for the concert! We noticed some technicians moving up and down on the stage testing the instruments in the nearby hours before the concert. Someone checking on the piano, the organ and some guy testing the drums. There was one (or two) who tried out Steve &amp; Bruce's guitars, I didn't notice anyone testing any of Nils' guitars, but maybe it was just me who missed it! I also noticed how the Big mans sax was the last instrument to be brought onstage! The show was set to kick off at 20:00, and around 19:55 the light-technicians came onstage and climbed up the ladders to the bridge were they would manage the lights from, and we knew something was about to happened, and soon. Those two hours with waiting inside of the stadium went pretty fast I'd say! And then\u2026. around 20.10 it happened! Bruce 'The Boss' Springsteen took the stage! With a black 12 string acoustic guitar! From the latest setlist I was pretty sure he would kick off the show with the acoustic version of BitUSA, so this wasn't really a surprise to me. He started playing immediately after coming onstage! I've always preferred the full band version but it was an amazing show-opener the way he played it! The sound of his guitar roamed through the stadium.<br/>\nNext was The Rising\\Lonesome Day (as usual). Everyone of the band members took the stage at once when Bruce was done doing BitUSA, Max started the countdown and they went into The Rising! SO much better than any bootleg! Again the sound was blasting from the loud-speakers through the entire stadium, only difference: now it was the entire E STREET BAND! They looked like they was in great shape! Bruce's solo was far from how it is on the album, but it was still pretty cool. Nils really did a nice job with his slide playing I think! From the big screen it almost looked like he was trying to strangle his guitar there! Lonesome Day wasn't a letdown at all either! Great song, rocks big time, and works perfect as a follow up to The Rising! During the allright parts I'm pretty sure every single one of the 46\u00a0000 fans had both their hands above their heads! I love the bridge part to, the way it builds up, with Bruce &amp; Stevie first, then Clarence, and Nils. He took it to 'the next level' with his short solo.<br/>\nNext was the first surprise of the night. I didn't really know what to expect now, maybe Ties, No Surrender or Jackson Cage! But it couldn't be Jackson Cage as Bruce got his *new* Fender and not the 12-string, I assumed either Ties or No Surrender (as that one reappeared in Hamburg). But NO! We were in for a real treat: tour premiere of 'Take 'Em As They Come'. Last played in MSG 2000, and it was pretty rare even on that tour I think (correct me if I'm wrong)\u2026.. they didn't start it with the short instrumental like back on the previous tour, but Bruce launched right into the lyrics after changing his guitar after Lonesome Day, great version! At one point the band stopped playing, Bruce then started it again with his guitar while the rest of the band was clapping to build up the mood, as most of the crowd didn't know this one! And then\u2026. they barely ended Take 'Em before we heard the well-known opening tones of Prove It All Night! This one always sound like a highlight on the bootlegs, but it's such a bigger highlight when you're there! Bruce really seemed to stretch out the guitar solo at the end, and it went on for almost 2 minutes I guess! What a song! Now I was hoping we'd get another rocker before the acoustic numbers, and I was pleased to see Bruce getting an electric guitar from Kevin! 'My Love Will Not Let You Down'! Looks like this one is turning into a regular for the stadium tour, that's good! Just like Prove It I think this one is so much better live than on the album! The guitar-jamming at the end with Nils - Bruce &amp; Stevie in a row was fantastic! Very powerful!<br/>\nEmpty Sky: After 3 hard rockers AFTER The Rising\\Lonesome Day I was pretty sure they would now go into the acoustic spot, and they did! Empty Sky is so beautiful, and I'm surprised how well it worked in a big outdoor stadium! The same goes for You're Missing too! Maybe even more sad! Now I know why Bruce keep performing these two every single night! I still think Nothing Man and (especially) Paradise deserve to be played more, but not instead of Empty Sky &amp; You're Missing!<br/>\nAnd now the highlight for my very good friend: Waitin' On A Sunny Day! When You're Missing was finished and the band changed their instruments I asked him if he was ready to sing ?! 'I'm pretty sure we'll get Sunny Day' now I said. I know that one, he said with a big smile on his face! And we did have to sing! Soozie does some nice violin 'riffs' on this one, and the entire song really gets the crowd going! I was impressed by Bruce who turned upside down on his mic, that was strong! He has to be in very good shape! Very cool too! Like in Barcelona last year Stevie got to sing the first chorus, and Bruce called him over like this: Sing it Stevie you sexy thing! Very funny, and it made Stevie burst into laughing, which gave him huge problems with the singing! Great! Now I was holding my breath and wondering about what he would play next! I noticed a harmonica in his left hand when he got up to the mic, and man it was fantastic! Everything about the song: I love it! the harmonica, the singalong at the end, the solos\u2026 Tremendous! Miser I ain't a boy\u2026 no I'm a man\u2026 and I believe in a Promised Land! Next up was Worlds Apart! I was hoping for one more oldie first, but I wasn't disappointed either! It seemed a little shorter now than from the latest bootlegs I've heard! But it was still very good! Nils does a hell of a job on this song! His banjo playing really adds an eastern touch to the song! Especially now that the playback of the Africans group is almost completely removed! Nils also took the first short electric solo! And I was glad he was allowed to join Bruce &amp; Stevie for a solo at the end again. He is one hell of a guitar player, and I noticed how he played three different guitars during this song! I also noticed Danny playing the accordion on this one, to great effect!<br/>\nShort bridge and BADLANDS was next! The ultimate Bruce song number 3 to me, only beaten by BTR &amp; Thunder Road! A definitive highlight of the show! Unlike the MTV broadcast from last years concert in Barcelona Stevie now took the solo! And I'm glad he did! I think he puts more into his solos than Bruce (at least this one), and he did make it sound better! A smart-move from Bruce to give more of the solos to the two other guitarists! Badlands wasn't actually a surprise, but I was really looking forward to hear it. And to be honest, it was a whole lot better than I would have ever dreamed of! \"Can I get a witness\u2026. ?\" What's up with that? And \"Are You Ready To meet me\u2026. ?\" That makes more sense though\u2026 Out In The Street!!! Great follow up to Badlands! Bruce is truly enjoying to perform this song, which is great to see live I think! So much better when you're there compared to any bootleg, and Live In NYC - both the DVD &amp; CD! I would definitely not have been without this song! They played it very well, and it had a great effect to the crowd! The highlight of the song was when the band members (Stevie, Patti, Nils &amp; Clarence) all got to sing a line! Great song anyway, but I would rather see She's the One there on Thursday, rather than OITS twice, but I won't complain about that one either! Are You Ready ??? !!! House-party, at Mary's Place! Great! He sang the extra verse at the beginning with 'there's a place, right across two whenever you're ready\u2026' and so on! I was afraid it was going to be long, but it wasn't! The band intros was great!<br/>\nNext up was the 2nd big surprise of the night! I saw Bruce getting his telecaster and Nils the acoustic one, I know that's the guitars they're playing on Downbound Train, and it was played in Hamburg so I thought maybe 2 nights in a row. I would of course not mind that at all, but we got Point Blank! And the best version I've ever heard! better than any bootleg I've heard! The 'spiritual' sax intro from the reunion tour was gone, and I didn't really miss it! Bruce had to sing the first line before I recognized it! Great performance! He really pout a lot into his singing and did barely touch his guitar! Stevie on the other hand did a very nice job on the guitar, he looked so focused! He barely took his eyes of his guitar during the entire song! Roy's piano was excellent to, along with Danny's organ. The four of them together (Bruce, Stevie, Danny &amp; Roy) made this song I think. An outstanding performance! If PB gets played again on the tour I doubt it will be any better than this\u2026<br/>\n\"oh-oh-oh-oh-ohhhhhhhhh\u2026\u2026.\" or something like that, be glad you can't hear me! Patti does it so great! the intro to Into The Fire which was next after PB! Great version! I know this is far from the best piece of the Rising album, but I think it is a little better live than on the album! And the way he keep repeating the lyrics: May your strength give us strength and so on makes it powerful! A very emotional song, that looks pretty important to Bruce to perform! I've finally started to like it :)<br/>\nAnd now, sorry for those of you who can stand this long review if you read all the way to this point, I will have to apologies if I get personal! Anyway\u2026 After ITF I was expecting Tenth as I knew that was played the last couple of nights, but NO! Bruce got his *new* Fender from Kevin and I got what I wanted most of all: Thunder Road! I can't believe what I heard! So beautiful! I was praying I would hear it at my first show but I didn't dare to hope for it! but Thunder Road it was, in all it's glory! I have to admit I felt a tear in my eye as I enjoyed every second of this masterpiece! Lying out there like a killer in the sun, hey I know it's late we can make it if we run. Oh Thunder Road, sit tight take hold, Thunder Road! Priceless!!!<br/>\nEnd of main-set. Bruce &amp; The E Streeters leaves the stage pretty fast! One minute later they're back up there! I didn't really know what to expect, but Bobby jean would seem very likely! But the guitar intro from Bruce made no doubt: Darlington County!!! This is an encore song now I think! A lot of fun, and another opportunity for the crowd to singalong. My friend found it funny how it was now Nils now sharing the mic with Bruce for a short verse! Great solos at the end by Clarence &amp; Soozie!<br/>\nDarlington County was barely finished before they launched in to Bobby Jean! I love this song, and was very pleased to hear it! Worked great after Darlington County! Nils does some nice guitar work on this one! Great solo at the end by the Big Man!<br/>\nAre you ready to roadhouse? !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ramrod! So much goofing around, so funny! At some bootlegs I happend to find this one a bit long, but when you're there it's almost to short! All compliments to the professor (Roy Bittan) who was left alone at the stage and stayed there for a couple of minutes and played a long rocking piano solo! And then someone came onstage and put a cowboy hat on his head before Bruce and the band got back up behind him! I think it was his wife who came out with the cowboy hat! Highlight: Bruce: Stevie\u2026. what I wanna know is\u2026.. what time is it ???\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 (all the silence in the world)\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. Stevie: As I expected\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. IT'S BOSS TIME !!!!!!!!!!<br/>\nNo more comments needed I think! One two three four\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. and the ultimate Bruce song. BORN TO RUN !!!!! Quick question: is the comments on this one really needed ?! I guess not, but as this was my first Bruce show it was really special to see and hear it with all the lights on! It was actually pretty dark by now! 'Cause Tramps Like Us\u2026.. Baby We Were Born To Run !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Without any break after BTR he went straight into Seven Nights To Rock! Which was pretty good! A real encore song as well! A good way to end the first encore, without any doubt! I've heard the mp3 from the first time they performed it in Paris, and luckily it was a lot better by now! Both Stevie &amp; Nils got to play some great solos on it! I also noticed an unknown man next to Patti onstage (?) Who was this?! He played the same electric guitar that Patti does on Ramrod, and he was singing with her in her mic at the chorus! At the end I got the answer from Bruce himself, he pointed at him and said: my brother in law! And that was the end of the first encore! My friend was by now a little disappointed and said: already done ?! This must have been among his shortest shows if it's true what you're telling me, that they usually play for almost 3 hours! Hell no if this is the end I said, and we were both glad I was right! Now Bruce sat down behind the piano and started off a very moving version of My City Of Ruins! And it was very moving! They way they play it live is a lot better than the album version. Great solos in the middle from Danny, Clarence and Soozie! The 'Come On Rise Up' part at the end worked very powerful, especially considering how he started it solo at the piano! A very nice song!<br/>\nOnce MCoR was done Max started the well-known rhythm, and there it was, Bruce came up to the mic and said it himself as he started to play his guitar, \"This is Land Of Hope And Dreams\"! And when you think of it: it does sound that way! Very good song, with a nice arrangement, and some genius lyrics from Bruce! No matter how much I enjoy this song I couldn't help but having random feelings about it! I loved it, and enjoyed it very much, on the other hand I felt a little sad knowing that it was about to come to an end. GREAT song, superb 'almost show-closer'!<br/>\nAfter LOHAD the band now gathered in front of the stage and held up their hands and thanked everybody! Now Bruce started to make a point of pretending to be so worn out he couldn't get his guitar of the ground, and needed the crowds help! And he got it, of course! And Dancing In The Dark was a great song to finish after LOHAD! I've never been a big fan of this song, until last year, in Tacoma in August, when he started to play it in the new arrangement, like a real rocker! It works so good! A lot better than the pop-style version on the album! Did went pretty fast and again the band was back at the front holding up their hands and thanking us, while we was thanking them at the same time! The mood was still unbelievable. I turned to my buddy and said: 'Now it's the end I'm afraid'. He just looked back at me with a 'Yeah, right!'-expression on his face and said: Hell no! I'm glad I was wrong and he was right! Bruce again took his Telecaster and started of Glory Days! Great party-song which rocks big time! I love this song, and I'm glad Bruce can find room for both Ramrod &amp; GD in the encores! GD was (unfortunately) the last song, but on the other hand it worked great as the final number of the concert! Luckily it was a LONG Glory Days with a lot of goofing around! And with Stevie playing the mandolin after the 2nd chorus! Again Stevie was referred to as 'You Sexy Thing'! Now, for those who say Glory Days sounds a little rusty and worn out: You've got a problem, if he plays it and you don't want to hear it, it's your problem! Leave for the bathroom (or something). Find yourself a tree or whatever ;-) Glory Days rocks !!! And that was it. I never think I've been witness to three hours that went of so fast! To fast I'd say! Can't wait 'till Thursday!<br/>\nMy second show at Valle Hovin, Oslo, Norway! Anyway\u2026 I think Bruce, and the band too, was in a great mood on this beautiful night in Copenhagen and they rocked the house (or stadium) for three solid hours! Before we left the stadium we payed a little attention to the big screens where they played an acoustic version of Countin' On A Miracle with Bruce solo on the acoustic guitar! Pretty sweet! And with that I think the most important is said! A HUGE Thank You for those of you who has the courage to read the entire review. For those of you who does not: I understand you!!! It's just that after a experience like that you have to relive it you know, that's what I just did. I'm sorry it turned out to be SO long. Now I'm going to quote a line that Bruce and Stevie sang to each other (on the BITUSA tour I think) that is pretty special to me: (to Bruce). Thanks for the joy that you've given me !!!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Jens</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">What a Great Night. It was my 2 concert with Bruce. - First time was in Sweden 18 years ago. It was fantastic then, but this time even better. I was placed up on the roof far from the stage, but the atmosphere was great. Bruce entered the stage solo, and gave \"Born in the USA\" acoustic\"\" - and then \"The Rising\" and 4-5 other rocking songs. \"Prove it all Night\" really got us up from the seat. \"Empty Sky \" - What a thrill listening to 40000 people singing like a silent echo - \"Waiting on a Sunny Day\", turned the show into a party and \"Badlands\" was the song where the whole stadium was like a waving see. After nearly 3 hours the show was over after \"Dancing in the Dark\" - but then came \"Glory Days\" Thank You for a Great Night.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Bruce certainly gave you your moneys worth (if that is appropriate to say?) with a huge interest added. Absolutely fabulous. I have never seen anything in Helsinki like that before. The crowd went absolutely wild and \"The Boss\" took them like only he can.

The show started when Bruce just casually strolled up to the mike and started with an acoustic Born in the USA. Missing was magical and Into the Fire like more religious than ever. No Surrender was a surprise and City of Ruins, amazing on the album, but even more surreal live. Bruce made a joke that he would \"play until the sun went down\"\u2026 the thing is that in June in Helsinki the sun doesn't set! The Big Man and the rest of the band \"Mr. Late Night Television\" and the cross between \"Jerry Lewis and Liberace\" were on and rocking. Finnish law states that shows must end by 11 so we probably missed Jungleland but the raw energy of the past, while still being maintained for hours, is transforming into a sense that what is being witnessed is not of this world and that only the Boss can capture the ordinary so perfectly and make you be so proud to just be another joe fighting for survival. His shows are revivals and he is the master of rock and roll. So help me God!\"</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Two songs shorter than Copenhagen but I still don't know which one was the best of those two. I tried last time to do my best to not become to personal, but I doubt I can avoid it totally this time.<br/>\nI meet up outside of Valle Hovin around 13:30 that day, and joined the allready started line. The GA line was organised with numbers and stuff so people wouldn't have to stand there all day long day. Thanks to the person who did it, for his hard work!<br/>\nOutside the stadium I finally got to meet some Lakers in person! Souldriver72 (Hey man, hope you get some GREAT shows in Sweden this weekend), Dr.Zoom &amp; Magnus (hello again both), 'On_Fire' and hmmmm\u2026\u2026 a couple of others to (can't remember their names right now)\u2026\u2026\u2026<br/>\nAnd not to forget, Eric from the USA (who bought my extra ticket I got when this guy all the sudden had to cancel\u2026) Lucky for him, and lucky for me he bought it.<br/>\nTo all the great people (and Bruce fans) I meet outside of Valle Hovin, I hope I will see you again some time!<br/>\nThe doors was set to open at 17:00 so after organising the line at 16:00 we just stood there for the next hour. About 17:00 I could feel my stomach starting to tingle. At 17:10 the gates was still closed. And I started to worry they might open one gate before another, and we really didn't want that to happend! Finally\u2026 around 17:30 the gates opened. The GA line went pretty fast and all the sudden I was the there. I showed my ticket and run in. And did I get a good spot?! Yes, indeed! Fourth row from the fence, in front of Nils! From that spot I actually made eye-contact with both Clarence and Nils. And later in the encores with Bruce himself!<br/>\nThe weather was good, not any dark clouds or anything, the sun was shinging and everything looked like we were in for a great show. Luckily we was! By the way, security wasen't very good, I went in with a sack and nobody searched it. It wasen't really nccessary in my case but in some others\u2026 I think it was!<br/>\nThe waiting from 17:30 to 19:00 went pretty fast I'd say, and no need to mention it anymore. The concert was set to start at 19:00, so again, around 19:00\u2026.. the tingle.<br/>\nunfortunotly we noticed some trouble with one of the cameras in front of Bruces mic. Now the waiting started to get painful. But enough about that. 19:40 (or 45): Danny &amp; Roy took the stage together. And the rest of the band followed, Clarence was the second last to enter, and then\u2026 BRUCE !!!!!!!!!<br/>\nNow I knew we wasen't getting the acoustic BitUSA to open with. Kinda good I thought. Now I was hoping for 6 rockers to open (like Helsinki 2nd night).<br/>\nOver to the setllist:<br/>\nSong number one: The Rising.No big surprise really! Great as always. Again I will have to mention Nils' slide playing! Very good. Sound was okay, but not the best, Bruce's solo didn't sound especially good, that might have been because the sound was very loud, and not especially clear.<br/>\nNext: Lonesome Day. As always great follow-up to The Rising! The allright parts with the hands and stuff worked well to get the crowd going. The bridge instrumental was the highlight for me!<br/>\nAfter LD Prove It All Night followed immediately, great as always. I think I mentioned in my previous review (from Copenhagen) how I'd like to see Nils taking the solo in The Rising. But I can't really see an elegant Nils solo at the end of Prove It! Great guitar-work from Bruce!<br/>\nProve It didn't really end before Max' drums lead straight into My Love\u2026 This one rocked big time. I was hoping to get another high tempo rocker given that I got this one in copenhagen. But I didn't complain either.<br/>\nThen\u2026 I noticed by the guitars, Bruce. *new* Fender - Nils the black one, this had to be either Ties, No Surrender or Darkness\u2026. heavy counting from Bruce ONE\u2026\u2026..TWO\u2026\u2026\u2026..THREE\u2026\u2026\u2026FOUR\u2026\u2026.. By now I knew what was comming, and YES! I was right. Darkness! I was hoping for this one, and yeah, I got it So bitter. Bruce really put alot in the performance I think. It's obvious how this is an important song too him, that he cares alot about. From all the botolegs I've heard, I have yet to hear an unmotiveted version of Darkness On The Edge Of Town. Even including the acoustic Joad version! And tonight wasen't any exception. GREAT version.<br/>\nAfter Darkness I was hoping for one more rocker (like Helsinki 2nd night) but the stage went dark and most of the band went off! Empty Sky was next (as expected). I really like this song in it's live version. Very improved from the album version, and so sad. Beautiful<br/>\nOutisde of the stadim I mentioned to a couple of other Lakers how I was hoping for The river. But we totally agreed about dropping You're Missing was a 2nd night-thing. But hell no: As usual Bruce went up to the mic withouth a guitar after ES. At this moment I was holding my breath in excitement, and the the time was stading still.. but I noticed a harmonica in his left hand. And the unbelieveable beautiful intro started.<br/>\nTHE RIVER! Original version, in all it's glory. Almost made me cry. So beautiful. Nica harmony vocals from Patti! Steve's playing (on the acoustic guitar) was very beautiful. And at the end Soozie added a nice violin solo. A deffinetive highlight for me, along with Darkness\u2026 Nils stayed at his pedal steel guitar (or whatever it's called) and he wasen't really that important to this song, as I hardly noticed him. Roys piano playing was excellent (as always).<br/>\nReady to sing along?! Waitin' On A Sunny Day was next! Cool as always, with Bruce walking around with his mic in his hand really working the crowd, hanging upside down at his mic. the knee slide, and the crowd getting to sing the chours!<br/>\nNext up was another highlight for me, and I noticed a guy outside the stadium making a sign for it, and obvious he got what he wanted, and I beth he was happy about it. It would be a lie to say I wasen't happy about it either! Sherry Darling!!! Really cool. Worked extremly good right after Waitin'. Good version, with Bruce making us (the corwd) end the song, by singing Sherry Darling, only to start it over again. A lot of fun!<br/>\nWithout a seconds break they went straight into Worlds Apart! I was hoping for one more oldie first, but I couldn't really complain either. I had allready got, Darkness\u2026 The River &amp; Sherry Darling. Three classics, with one I didn't dare to hope for (the River).<br/>\nI really enjoyed Nils' banjo on WA, and Soozies violin solo in the middle. Also the 'Ah-ah-ah\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..' part from the band. The solos at the end, by Stevie, Nils, and Bruce was fabolous!<br/>\nBADLANDS followed WA. Among my Top-5 favourites! And obviously among everyone else's Top-5. Worked great as always. Doesen't really need any more comments I think.<br/>\nNow I was hoping to hear 'She's the One' as I heard Out In The Street in Copenhagen. I was aware of also that being a second night thing, but after The River everything looked possible. But I wasen't dissapointed at the time I heard Bruce and the band start OITS! When I'm listening to bootlegs I some times find this song a bit long (and boring), and I tend to skip it, but when you're there, it's so good! Made me realise I wouldn't be without it!<br/>\nMary's Place followed immediately. Not the best track on the album, and not among his finest work, but it's alot of fun in concert. Worked great with the crowd to, and perfect for the band introductions.<br/>\nNow what was next\u2026 at least I wasen't expecting another outing of Point Blank like in Copenhagen. And another highlight of the show was in progress: JUNGLELAND! Beautiful piano intro, and the violin was there to! I said Mary's Place wasen't among Bruce's finest work, but Jungleland is! A true masterpiece! The intro was very moving, Bruce's vocals was great, and Stevie played the guitar solo to great effect! And then: the Big Man! About 4 or 5 minutes long solo I guess. And he nailed it pretty darn good. That has to take alot, to play a long solo like that on a saxofon! Bruce is right: You all wish you could be just like him, but you can't\u2026. 'cause there's only one Clarence BIG MAN Clemons!<br/>\nTrue words Bruce!<br/>\nInto The fire was next! Patti does an unbelievealbe intro, hear voice is tremendous. I don't think her voice fits in that good in every song, but she is a very important block of this song. Great intro! The rest of it was okay, not my favourite, but I've started to like it.<br/>\nAfter ITF Bruce changed his guitar and got back to the mic. I know prepared myself for Thunder Road. My favourite\u2026 but NO! Promised Land! What a surprise to get this one after ITF, that had to be the first time of the tour I guess\u2026 (?) Needless to say it worked great. I was glad to hear it at my 2nd concert to.<br/>\nAnd that was the end of the main set. Bruce and the band left the stage in a hurry. A minute or two later they were back.<br/>\nAt this point I didn't really know what to expect! \"We're gonna try to play this song for that guy out there\" Bruce said and pointed somewhere in the crowd. I'd noticed a sign asking for either, Sandy, Kitty's Back, or Rosie, I knew it could not be Rosalita, so I thought we would get Kitty or Sandy. Bruce continued by saying: \"If we f*** this one up\u2026\u2026 then so what\u2026\" and started to laugh! And with that they launched straight into 'Where The Bands Are'! They didn't screw it up at all! A nice surprise for me. I'm almost a 100% sure this was for the first time of the 2003 leg. So\u2026. although it was played a few times back in the states in 2002 this was an 'almost premiere'! Great version anyway. Good solos by Clarence and Stevie! Where The Bands Are rocked !!!<br/>\nBobby Jean followed immediately! I heard it in Copenhagen, heard it again, and didn't mind it! Good song, Nils was in focus alot during this song, I think he did a nice piece of work on his guitar! Kinda weird this song was focused so much on Nils, I've always thought it was written for Stevie, who left the band back then. But don't get me wrong, we don't get enough Nils I think\u2026 a matter of personal opinion I guess!<br/>\nNext: Are You Ready To Roahouse ?? !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>\nRamrod. Ramrod rocks! Bruce made some jokes about the Big Man while he was palying his solo and walking around at the front of the stage! \"The Big Man on the move\"! The moment of silence and Bruce asking Stevie what time is it (IT'S BOSS TIME!!!!!!!!!) works for me every time, SO cool! Like in Copenhagen Roy was left alone and played a long piano solo, and at the end it was his kids (I guess) who came up and put on him a viking-helmet! The band came back on stage behind Roy and continued to rock!<br/>\nThe Rising tour version of Ramrod IS the best!<br/>\nONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR\u2026 and the famous drum intro. 'Cause tramps like us\u2026 baby we were BORN TO RUN!!!!!!! With all the lights one, even though it wasen't really dark outside. The ULTIMATE Bruce song! No more comments needed I'd say!<br/>\nWithout one second of silence after BTR Bruce launched straight into 'Seven Nights To Rock'! Good version, probably a little shorter than the Copenhagen version, as neither Stevie or Nils played any solos this time! Good version anyway. And that was the end of the 1st encore.<br/>\nAfter a short break Bruce came back onstage and started My City Of Ruins at the piano. Very beautiful. And even better with the beautiful backing vocals from the other singers! Good to finally see Danny in the spotlight for a minute with a nice solo in the middle part. Clarence &amp; Soozie also played some good solos. The 'C'mon Rise Up !!!!!!!!!' part seems very powerful, even though he starts the song solo at the piano.<br/>\nMax started the drum intro, Bruce came up to his mic: 'This is Land Of Hope And Dreams' and started his guitar-playing. They nailed the song perfectly (like they do evry night). I enjoyed every single minute of this beautiful song, but I also felt the sadness inside of me knowing that the concert was comming to an end!<br/>\nLuckily they played Dancing In The Dark after LOHAD! Alot of fun, and the crowd was really into it. This wasen't really a surprise but still very good! After Ditd I knew the end was just around the corner, but I hoped for Glory Days, or at least one more. Unfortunotly, Ditd was THE END!<br/>\nAll together a good show, two songs shorter than Copenhagen, but still just as good! Two premieres (Take 'Em As They Come &amp; Point Blank) along with Thunder Road made Copenahgen seem unbeatable to me. But when I'm looking back at the Valle Hovin concert: Darkness\u2026 The River, Sherry Darling, Jungleland &amp; Where The Bands Are! I'm sorry, I guess I'll never get a clear answer to what was the better of my two Rising shows.<br/>\nBefore the show started I said to myself I didn't really need to hear Thunder Road as I got it in Copenhagen just a few days before. But I knew a couple of fans who were only going to this one show (and I meet one who was at his first show), and I really felt sorry for them who didn't get Thunder Road! I also kinda missed it myself!<br/>\nAfter they had left the stage and the crew was taking the instruments, mics. and stuff down I stayed for a little while and enjoyed the acoust version of Cuntin' On A Miracle' at the big screens. Will it ever be released, or does it excist on a bootleg or something?!<br/>\nI also talked to some fans.<br/>\nThere was this one guy who was lucky enough to get a setlist. He was very kind and allowed me to have a look at it. I noticed a couple of surprises there:<br/>\n- No Surrender was on the setlist in the spot where they played Sherry Darling<br/>\n- You're Missing was on the setlist, AFTER Into The Fire<br/>\n- Where The Bands Are wasen't on the setlist, and neither was 7 nights to rock<br/>\n- Glory Days was on the setlist before Ditd, but wasen't played!<br/>\nA couple of surprises there I'd say. I did want to hear No Surrender, but if I had to choose between that one and Sherry Darling, I'm pretty sure it would have been Sherry Darling, so NO complains\u2026<br/>\nYou're Missing is very beautiful and moving, but I can't imagine it would have worked any good after ITF and as the Main-set closer! I felt a little sorry we didn't get Glory Days at the end, But I doubt we would have got both WtBA and 7NtR if that one was played! And given that I got Glory Days in Copenhagen I'd rather take Where The bands are in the first encore at Valle Hovin, so that didn't matter!<br/>\nThe random feelings about this show? My last Bruce show for now\u2026 I hope there will be others in the future! I have to admit I am a bit jelous at some of the other norweginas on this board who is spending the weekend in Sweden, with Bruce\u2026<br/>\nNo lies to say these two nights (Copenhagen &amp; Oslo) was among the greatest time of my life so far.<br/>\nBack at my auntie (in Oslo) that night I fell asleep listening to the sweet sound of 'Paradise' from the CCat's bootleg from the 7-30 show! The perfect ending to a perfect night with Bruce. After the two concerts I felt like I'd been in Paradise and got a taste of it. Paradise tasted good.<br/>\nWith that, it's only one thing left to say: THANKS Bruce, I hope I'll get to see you again!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Christian Falck Olsen</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">This was Bruce's best performance in Oslo ever, too bad not many realized this. The setlist was very good, the crowd mostly lousy (except for the people from approximately the mixing desk and to the stage), Steve was very anonymous, clearly having an off night, but Clarence, Max and especially Bruce were having a great night. I've never seen Bruce this intense and energetic before, the songs up until Sherry Darling were performed with incredible energy and passion. The energy level continued to be high throughout the show, with great band intros in Mary's Place, an absolutely incredible Jungleland (Clarence did a magnificent job) a tight, but loose Where The Bands Are (I love this song and was thrilled to get it) and the best Ramrod I've seen to date (this is including the two Swedish shows). That said, the crowd appeared to be tame (and I think I'm being kind, here) and it was not in lack of Bruce trying. According to my girlfriend who had seats at the side, people were relatively responsive during the \"old\" songs, like Dancing, but weren't even clapping along to Lonesome Day, for instance. People in the front were going absolutely nuts during most parts of the show, so at least we did our job. I almost - almost - hope he skips Oslo next time around. The venue he has to play must be the worst on the entire planet, the crowds are usually way too reserved (bordering on rudeness, IMO) and the media coverage and overall attention sucks. I'd much rather see him in Sweden. Conclusion: very good show (thanks to Bruce, Clarence and Max), mostly bad crowd (at least 2/3 of it), incredibly bad venue. It will probably be one of those shows that will sound very good on boots. It had the potential to be one of the top 3 Scandinavian shows, I think, but the crowd failed to make it that.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Magnus Lauglo</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">It was clear from the moment that Bruce took the stage that he was in great spirits. He was not alone, but came onstage after the full band, and they kicked into The Rising, which works far better as an opener than the acoustic BUSA they have been using for a while now. By the time they were playing Lonesome Day, I could tell they were on fire. Bruce seemed to have a lot of fun speaking Norwegian to the crowd at several points. If anyone seemed sub-par, it was Steve, who was much less energetic than usual, and looked like he had eaten too much lutefisk. But as the band went into a tremendous My Love Will not Let you Down, I saw Max's face break into an all-to-rare grin. He always plays like a machine, but it isn't always so easy to see how much he enjoys playing with the band, and this song really showcases him. Garry, I also noticed was more animated than he usually is. Clarence in particular, was consistently excellent for the whole show; more on that later.<br/>\nDarkness on the Edge of Town was the first real highlight of the show for me. Compared to the tepid version they offered in Manchester, this one cooked. Bruce sang the first part of each verse slowly, before crashing into the \"Well if she wants to see me?/'til one day/tonight I'll be on that hill\" lines and the chorus with impassioned fury. Bruce wrenched the guitar solo out of himself deliberately and almost agonizingly, note by note. It all came across very well. By this time several people had already been taken out of the crowd. It wasn't very uncomfortable around me, but lots of people seemed to have had enough further back, and were lead out via the communications canal.<br/>\nI was pleasantly surprised when we go a full band The River in the place of You're Missing. The Norwegian crowd recognized the song from the first note of the harmonica intro and roared in approval and recognition. I'd never heard the traditional version played by the ESB before, and it sounded magnificent - much as one would expect. At the end Bruce sang that ?Oooohhhhh? bit in that high ?border howl? he has been using since the Joad tour, and Suzi got a chance to shine as she played the same melody on her violin or fiddle. Waiting on a Sunny Day followed, and at one point Bruce actually dropped his guitar by accident, before throwing it to Kevin. (On the topic of guitars, I noticed that Bruce has stopped playing his original scratched up fender. We can all hope it is just on vacation rather than retired.) He ran out on the sides of the stage and hung upside down on his mike stand as usual, doing his best to engage the people sitting down far away from the stage.<br/>\nSherry Darling was played in response to a request sign (we were supposed to get No Surrender here according to the setlist), and I seem to remember it was a little better than it had been in London. Clarence nailed the solo, and Bruce danced around the stage goofily at the end. The ?Let there be sunlight let there be rain? line seemed to me very appropriate for the fans who had waited out in line. During the actual concert there was no rain at all, but there was a steady breeze for much of the show.<br/>\nAs expected, Mary Place had Bruce exhorting the Norwegians further away from the stage to get up from their seats. The crowd in general seemed better to me than the London crowd, but according to people who stood further back, they really weren't particularly animated at all. The Norwegian papers the next day blamed the lack of enthusiasm on poor sound, which might have been caused by the wind. At the front where I stood, it all sounded fine enough of course.<br/>\nJungleland was an audible, and it replaced the interestingly setlisted Promised Land/You're Missing in the pre Into the Fire slot. Considering the excellent shape that the Big Man was in, Jungleland, was the perfect choice. Valle Hovin doesn't have a roof, but if it had, his Jungleland sax solo would have blown it clear off. If this show belonged to any one band member after Bruce, it would have to be Clarence. I don't believe I've ever seen him play better. Compared to his uneven performance on for instance the London stand, he was ten times better. You could hardly tell he had aged at all - he nailed every solo that was thrown at him. Perhaps the changes to the written setlist reflected that Bruce could tell that the Big Man was in form, and wanted to showcase him as much as possible.<br/>\nPromised Land ended the main set (replacing the setlisted Thunder Road). It's clearly an important song for Bruce, and it nearly always sounds great. I'm glad that Bruce seems to have realized that there are better ways to close the main set than Into the Fire. It's interesting to see him experimenting with different songs for this vital slot every night.<br/>\nThe encores kicked off with another impromptu request; Where the Bands Are. Together with My Love earlier in the set, this made for 2 Tracks songs in one show, which was pretty nice. This was another song that Clarence has had had problems with in the past, but in Oslo, it sounded just fine. Bruce must have liked how it worked, as it was on the setlist (but not played) for the next show in Gothenburg.<br/>\nRamrod and Seven Nights were played to perfection, probably even better than they would be in Gothenburg. Ramrod saw Bruce standing as if petrified in stone with his mouth open for a minute or so, as Steve asked the crowd \"What time is it?\" Bruce joked about playing until 'the sun goes down. Does the sun go down here? Later, as I had anticipated, a plastic Viking helmet - complete with the historically incorrect horns was placed on Roy's head as the band sneaked back onstage. Seven Nights to Rock, which saw Bruce throw the guitar around his neck four times in a row, was an addition to the setlist. Notably, Bruce had initially decided not to play the song at all. It would be a shame if this song were to be lost, the show needs a standard cover, and few songs can fill the post BTR slot in the encores.<br/>\nThe second encore consisted of the standard songs, and ended on a high point with the high energy DITD, a song that everyone knows. By this time, it was actually pretty dark outside. If Bruce wanted to play somewhere where the sun truly doesn't go down, he would have to play above the Arctic Circle somewhere. I don't know if they have any big outdoor arenas up there, but I'm sure that a show that far north would be quite a spectacle. On another tour perhaps?<br/>\nThe press were less ecstatic about the show than I had expected. VG, which gave him a 5 out of 6, was generally positive about the show without being glowing, noting sound problems due to the wind, and suggesting that the concert got better after a while. (Conversely, in my opinion, it was perhaps the first hour which was the most spectacular). Aftenposten, gave the show a 4 out of 6. The reviewer used the term \"nostalgia\" a great deal - and not an a exclusively critical way. This reviewer thought that the show back in '99 had been better, because that had been wonderful nostalgia, whereas this time, that wonderful nostalgia was tempered by the new material which wasn't as good as the old songs. Still, overall a positive review, calling Bruce a very energetic rocker, who is still worth seeing live. Dagbladet also gave it a 4 out of 6, agreeing that the show was good, but not as good as the '99 show had been, and saying that the new material really brings down the show overall.<br/>\nI guess you can't please everyone. In my opinion, we got a terrific show, although the setlist and length of the show might have you believe otherwise. A friend of mine who had seen several shows before through the years, stood as far back as the soundboard and he said he thought the show was great. At 24 songs and just under three hours, Oslo got an overall a very fun performance, which maintained a consistent energy level throughout. Clarence as I have said, was at his peak, and both the unconventional written setlist and the multiple requested songs played, indicated that Bruce was in a loose mood. The crowd, though I have seen worse (cough, London), could have been much better, and would be put to shame by the Swedes only a few days later. But I left \"Europe's worst concert stadium\" feeling emotionally and physically tired and fulfilled at the same time. What more could I ask for?</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I had a chance to see him in Stockholm in October 2002, but I skipped that and I was on football instead. Bruce was even better that i though he would be. The best songs was \"Waitin' on a sunny day\", \"7 nights to rock\" and \"Twist and shout\". Twist and shout was twenty minutes long and it was a great crowd and we sing along with Bruce. I haven't heard 7 nights to rock before, but after the show its my new favorite song. We bought our tickets from the \"black market\" and we get tickets on row two, it was really good tickets. I really hopes that Bruce is coming back to Sweden soon, and next time i want to go to the both concerts if he plays two.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Magnus Lauglo</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">When the band came out, they were clearly excited. Clarence emerged wearing a midtsommar wreath of flowers in his hair. Bruce and the band clearly have many fond memories of Sweden, and throughout the show Bruce would frequently make jokes about breaking the stadium again. They went into The Rising to open up. I saw Clarence looking about himself in wonder during the first song. At both shows in Sweden, the crowd in front of the stage would bow to him in mock \"I am not worthy style\" whenever he played a solo. After being slightly subdued in Oslo Steve was back to his old self, crouched over his guitar like some sort of Teenage Mutant Guitar Hero Turtle. Nils, who was celebrating his birthday was in great spirits all night. The crowd loved him, and would go on sing Happy Birthday to him in both English and Swedish at various points throughtout the show. Only Patti, who seemed to be preoccupied with something quite upsetting didn't seem to be having a good time. She did loosen up later on, but she clearly wasn't having her best day.<br/>\nThe first few songs saw the crowd up front more lively and pushy than they had been at any of the shows I had seen before. It would take a little longer for the people in the reserved sections to rise up, but rise up they would. The Ties That Bind replaced the setlisted Promised Land and the rest of the early part of the set resembled Oslo in song selection. I think Darkness sounded better in Oslo, but only by a fine margin.<br/>\nYou're Missing returned to the set and seemed to work well enough in such a large stadium, but I was at the front, and couldn't tell what it was like further back. The band and crowd were a little distracted during this song, and the next few, by someone in a paraglider or parachute who hovered high over the stadium for a while, buffeted back and forth in the wind before disappearing. Whoever was up there must have gotten one hell of a view, but was ultimately distracting and a safety hazard for those below.<br/>\nAfter Waiting on a Sunny Day, Darlington County was setlisted, but Bruce grabbed a black acoustic guitar and went into an impromptu Working on the Highway, done in a similar way as it was on the last tour, except that at the end Suzi played a fun solo. It was loose, it was fun, it was completely unexpected. It was great, and the song deserves to be played some more over the course of the summer. It was followed by a muscular No Surrender, which I believe was also an audible.<br/>\nSeveral songs later, as Bruce was preparing the audience for the introductions to the E Street Band, he surprised me by declaring \"Before you can have a house party, three conditions have got to be satisfied. Or perhaps four tonight!\" Predictably, the music had to be righteous, twice in a row, and 'the Swedes have to get your Swedish asses out of your Swedish seats', But then it came; \"And four, we gotta\" break the stadium again! It was a great moment and a sign of things to come in the encores.<br/>\nWe got the full band version of The River next, for the third night in a row. I would expect it to be played a lot for the rest of the summer. It worked well in the slot between Mary's Place and Into the Fire, although some fans might have preferred a slightly older song in that spot. At this point, it is hard to see Bruce bring back a solo piano song to the show. He is playing massive stadiums every night now, and US crowds being what they are, I think it would be a mistake to try to pull out some of the solo piano songs that worked so well last year.<br/>\nThunder Road closed the main set after Into the Fire, instead of the setlisted no Surrender (which had been played already that night). The song sounds much better than it did on the last tour, probably because Bruce isn't insisting on singing it slowly anymore. It also works better than the others songs I've now seen in this position (Promised Land and No Surrender) With Clarence sounding so good these days, it would be a shame if this song dropped out from the show now. Expect it to make regular appearances for the rest of the summer, even if it doesn't come out every night.<br/>\nThe encores were loud and robust as usual, although the first encore set was quite standard. Lots of fans had expected Cadillac Ranch, because that would give Nils the opportunity to wear that massive foam cowboy hat on his birthday, and I had thought it might pop up in the encores, but this was not to be. They planned to play Where the Bands Are, but dropped the song, going instead into Bobby Jean. During Ramrod, a wreath of flowers was placed on Roy's head as he played his solo, right before Bruce returned to his mike to demand; \"OK Mr and Mrs Sweden, what time is it\"<br/>\nIf the first encore was a little disappointing, compared to Oslo, the second encore set did pack a little surprise, which many fans had been expecting for the second night. As Dancing in the Dark finished, and I thought the show was over, Bruce went up to the mike; \"One more for 1985!\" It was of course, a rambunctious Twist and Shout. Along with Working on the Highway, this was the song that got the crowd at the foot of the stage going completely mental. It must have lasted at least 7 minutes, or more and demonstrated how much the second encore benefits from a little less predictability. The fans in the very front in Europe are predominantly the ones who camped out, and have been to lots of shows already. A surprise or two thrown into the last hour of the show is a nice little gift for the fans who have heard Ramrod, Born to Run, MCOR., LoHaD and DITD a bunch of times already. I caught up with Webmaestro Karsten and Glory Roads after the show. As with all the GL people I met in G.burg, I would have liked to have more time to chat.<br/>\nThe first show in Gothenburg was a strong show which had its moments of magnificence. The Swedish newspapers loved it, I didn't get a chance to look properly, but I got the impression that the show got top grades in most, if not all the major newspapers. Certainly, the atmosphere before the show was unparalleled by anything I've seen (including the following night), but the band's performance will rank just below Oslo in my memory. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it even more if I had been more physically comfortable. It was a very hot day, there was a lot of pushing throughout the show, and in the second row, you don't have the benefit of the barrier that you do if you are in the very front. If Bruce could bring a stadium this size to life, it is clear that the problem with stadium shows is not inherently the size of the venue so much as the people sitting far away from the stage. The US summer tour will see shows at stadiums this size or bigger every single night. Those shows don't need to be an anticlimax, but only time will tell. At the Oslo show no alcohol was being sold inside the stadium. Perhaps this may be part of the answer of to how to deal with a huge crowd?</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

By the end of the Sunday concert the crowd urged Bruce and Band to come back on stage to do Twist &amp; Shout a 2nd time! 27 fantastic songs, many of them old favorites of mine.

Bruce paid homage to his host country when he and the band walked on to the stage to the sound of Mozart music! He also talked about being glad to perform in the country where so much great music was written - and he played \"Roll Over Beethoven\" as another reference to Austria`s reputation as a musical country. Roy Bittan even donned a traditional Austrian felt hat, complete with Edelweiss, when he played his piano solo at the end of Ramrod! A comment on Austrian food came after the first set of encores, when Bruce told the audience that he wanted to go back to the hotel for some beer and Wiener Schnitzel! \"Incident on 57th Street\", played for the first time ever in the full band version in Europe, was magical. I sadly missed \"You`re Missing\", but was rewarded with a haunting \"River\" version. If I contrast the \"Rising\" concert I saw in London last October at Wembley Arena with this stadium show, it becomes obvious that Bruce thrives on big crowds and grows with the challenge to motivate immense numbers of fans to be much more exhausted than he himself is at the end of a three hour show. When he told last night`s audience to \"get your Austrian asses out of your seats\", they did exactly what they were told! To sum it all up, another fantastic show, and Bruce, you have, for the umpteenth time, rekindled the fire in me! THANK YOU!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

The stadium middle tier stand I was privileged to part of was 'ROCKING' and i mean that literally. The chanting, the singing, the dancing was as good as I could of hoped for. A truly wonderful experience!! The show itself was memorable although I wouldn't say it was the best of the tour so far (Bruce appeared tired). Magical moments - The lights during Darkness, the crowd's reaction on hearing the opening of \"The River\". Bruce trying to find the 'G' for \"Who'll Stop the Rain\", the whole of \"Growin' Up\" and although I don't speak a word of Italian, clearly the locals found Bruce's mid song story very funny :-) I can only assume it was something special for them\u2026 \"Follow that Dream\" - what can you say!?!? I heard it during the soundcheck and goosebumps appeared, during the show it was beautiful and again done especially for the Milanese people. Finally \"Rosalita\" Oh my gosh!! I went ballistic when I heard the opening few notes, not sure the Milan crowd really understood how important this song was as the reaction from them was not as incredible as the say BITUSA songs. Lots will be said of the rain. It was torrential at times and the natural light show courtesy of the storm only added to the hot atmosphere within the San Siro. All in all a wonderful night of music, an experience that has to be seen to be believed, I kid you not the San Siro faithful are fantastic, really passionate about Bruce and the Band. Should you ever get another chance to catch Bruce in Milan, re-mortgage the house, sell the wife or indeed do whatever, just be there!!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">DB</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">I went all the way from Scotland to Milan and it was really worth the trip. Brilliant atmosphere, crazy fans who whooped and hollered all night long, hats of to the best! Great start to the set, introduced to the strains of Once Upon a Time In the West and straight into the Promised Land. Darkness was brilliant, Waiting on a Sunny Day in a downpour and Bruce in a big cowboy hat. A fantastic Rosalita (first time for me since 4th July 1985 at Wembley Stadium). The rain nearly stopped but the lightning never gave up and the stadium was really something to behold.<br/>\nSimply memorable, even if the band looked every so slightly tired they just never know when to give up!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Marco Lunari</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Bruce was not as brilliant as he was in Florence or in Bologna: probably he was tired. Furthermore the acoustic was quite bad. Despite this, the concert was simply great: San Siro Stadium was nearly full (60.000 people) and the people was very hot. Also because it was an anniversary: 20 years ago (21 June 1983) Bruce played in Milano and for the first time in Italy and it was one of his best show ever. I think that he remembered that night and, also because was the last European date, he wanted to make a great concert. And of course he did. I suppose that was for this reason that he played some rarities like Rosie and Follow that dream and a lots of hits like Thunder road , Growin' up and Darkness. The biggest problem (at least for all the guys in the middle of the stadium: the terraces were covered) was the rain: while Buce was singing Empty sky the sky was full of clouds and the first drops of rain begun to fall. During the river it started to rain and while Bruce was singing the first lines of waitin' on a sunny day ( It's raining but there ain't a cloud in the sky ) the rain fall harder. Bruce played Who ll stop the rain : I ever wished to hear that song but I could not enjoy it because the rain was so hard that I could hardly take my eyes open. After that thanks to God the rain stopped but we were all drenched to the bones. Well, what else? A really great version of My city of ruins : when Bruce came to the first refrain all the stadium sung with him come on, rise up but the crowd begun singing come on very softly like a whisper and ended with a rise up that sounded like a roar, and every time It grew louder and stronger but always really in tune. I've seen Bruce s expression: he seemed to be stroked and this gave him the hint for a very emotionally performance. Last but non least the \"ciliegina sulla torta\": ROSALITA!!! I didn't believe it! After all this time I was hearing again Bruce singing this masterpiece! FANTASTICO! Sam Vaughan is right when he says that many people didn't realize how important is this song. But it was because there were many young gals (19-25 years) that don t know the first Bruce's songs. (in Florence beside me there was a man that had never heard Kitty s back !): believe me, a lot of us knows what Rosie means.<br/>\nP.S.: in Florence Bruce played Tougher than the rest because it was his wedding anniversary. Of course he dedicated the song to Patti.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Gabriele Lanfranco</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">The show began at 8.15 sharp. It was scheduled to begin at 8.30, but in Milan for the summer outdoor concerts there is a curfew of 11\u00a0pm. I think Bruce would have started even sooner (at 7.50 everything was ready on stage) but there were a lot of people still entering the place. show ran for 3 exact hours (will Bruce pay a fine for playing over the curfew?). It was evident that Bruce wanted to play more after Rosalita, but basically they forced him off stage. He was still thanking the crowd and already there was the \"miracle\" acoustic video playing on the screens. The show began with the pre-recorded intro of Ennio Morricone \"Once Upon a Time in the West\", as the band were walking on stage one by one. Bruce just said 1.2.3. &gt; and we were off to the Promised land. One of the cooler concert beginnings I ever saw. Rain began during empty sky. during the river it had turned into a real thunderstorm. Bruce put on a white cowboy hat before sunny day (he took it from the audience, I think to cover the radio mike) and sang the whole song running on the swings, under the storm. When Bruce sang \"it's raining but there ain't a cloud in the sky\", he looked to the sky and then winked to the audience. The audience, who were beginning to run away from the lawn to seek shelter from the storm, got mad and returned en-masse to the field. Singing and dancing in the rain!!!! Lighter rain went on for the whole show. The sound was awful for the first 2-3 songs. They got it right during \"darkness\", but then the storm (complete with thunders and lightning, and heavy wind) ruined it. It took a lot of time to re-adjust it. They re-got it right during \"worlds apart\". I think the water and humidity ruined the radio mikes. For example: Clarence had problems all night, even Bruce mike was fucking up big time. Anyway, from badlands onwards the sound was ok. Bruce speech before \"empty sky\" (in Italian): \"it's great to be back in San Siro after all these years, for the first time since 1985. I hope they've been good years for you\". Bruce speech during \"growing up\" (in Italian): \"so here I am in 1985, playing for the first time in Italy, and I see in front of me thousands of crazy Italians screaming Bruce-Bruce-Bruce. And I just can't believe it. That was the beginning of our love affair. We've really grown up together. it's good to be back, it's like coming back home.\" People around me were crying. I have goose bumps writing this. Follow that dream: \"a song for Milano\". Bobby jean: people crying, incredible arm-waving in the field. like in the BTR 1985 video. Bruce before city of ruins: we'll be back soon. Bruce before dancing in the dark: he thanks the crew of the euro tour, and spells all their names at incredible speed.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Sherry Darling had the building rocking (not kidding). If Sherry Darling had the building rocking, Badlands plain and simple moved the foundation. Back to the tears with Into The Fire followed by No Surrender. Amazing how they all fit together. Not a better first encore to be found then Bobby Jean Ramrod Born to Run. 60,000 people thrusting fists to tramps like us. Seven Nights To Rock opens a second encore followed by a wonderful version of My City of Ruins. Bruce offers this song to the NJ Food Banks and to Asbury Park. Land Of Hope and Dreams puts a bow tie on the evening. I would have been happy to say good night and lets do it all again in a few days. What followed might have been one of the most amazing moments of any concert that I have ever been too. With Bruce teasing this is the one, get up because this is the one the opening of Rosalita took opening night to level that concerts just don t get to very often. When I noticed this guy sitting next to me, who before the show, said he had been to 30 35 shows and all he wants to hear is I ain't here for business, I'm only here for fun when that guy has tears rolling down his face, not much else needs to be said.

As July 15th drew nearer and nearer, my anticipation grew to a point where nothing else mattered - just Bruce. And he did not disappoint. Opening the show with a solo Born in the USA was something that I felt was a very bold move - making a statement while showcasing a brilliant reworking of a tremendous song. In the parking lot prior to the show everyone was wondering just what he would open with - from \"Summertime Blues\" to \"Seven Nights to Rock,\" but this worked just fine. \"The Rising\" and \"Lonesome Day\" continued to prove powerful and worthy of the opening spots. And the adrenaline continued with \"The Promised Land,\" an inspired \"My Love Will Not Let You Down,\" (with Max's blistering drums) as well as a great \"Darkness on the Edge of Town.\" As has been customary on the 2002-03 tour, Bruce then brought the show down with \"Empty Sky\" and \"You're Missing.\" Some felt these songs may not work in a stadium, but they served as a reminder than the World Trade Centers are no longer visible from the Turnpike right outside of Giants Stadium, and functioned brilliant in their own right. \"Waitin' on a Sunny Day\" continued to be a fun number, with Bruce knee-sliding across the stage and flipping himself upside-down on his microphone stand - a truly great moment. In keeping with the summer sing-a-long, a great \"Sherry Darling\" was played, followed by the powerhouse trio of \"World's Apart,\" \"Badlands,\" and \"Out in the Street,\" one of Bruce's truly great stadium songs. After the band intros and fun of \"Mary's Place,\" one of the first surprises surfaced, a full-band version of \"The River,\" fit with a beautiful falsetto and violin solo at the song's end. \"Into the Fire\" was great as always, and the band going into \"No Surrender\" worked tremendously well. \"Thunder Road\" closed off the main set with Bruce doing a knee slide to Clarence, giving the audience a slight nostalgic feeling. The first encore picked up with crowd-pleasing \"Bobby Jean,\" and continued with the stunning \"Ramrod.\" The on-stage antics between Springsteen and E Street Band member Steven Van Zandt were entertaining, as was Bruce and the entire band exiting the stage, leaving piano playing Roy Bittan all alone. Bittan's piano solo was another true highlight of the night, and the band came back on stage to finish out the rocker. Then came everyone's concert favorite \"Born to Run,\" the anthem of New Jersey. But the encore would not be complete without a song that summed up the seven night run. Well, what better than \"Seven Nights to Rock.\" Although not everyone in the crowd was familiar with the words, the song proved to be an all out rocker and was another true highlight of the night. The second encore began with \"My City of Ruins,\" which was dedicated to the local food bank as well as Asbury Park. \"Land of Hope and Dreams,\" the only low point of the show, followed with a brief public service announcement about the United States' involvement in the war with Iraq. After the LOHAD, Bruce pulled all of the band to the front of the stage. Feigning not being able to lift his famous Telecaster, Bruce did a dead-on Robert DeNiro impression of not being able to play anymore. But the night was not over yet. Bruce yelled out \"This is the one,\" but not all of the crowd got it. Could this be a joke? Nope, \"Rosalita\" came out and was the highlight of the night, proving that thirty years after it was first penned it was still was one of the Boss' best concert rockers. And then came a newer rocker, the reworked \"Dancing in the Dark.\" The powerhouse duo of Rosie and Dancing brough the energy level up to heights seemingly impossible, and for a moment it was like the crowd was transported back 18 years to the days of \"Born in the USA,\" when Bruce was the biggest thing out there. And for this one night (and probably the next six as well), he really was.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Some tips - don't worry about your seating. In 90% of the seats, you cant see the band anyway - so just take in the energy level wherever you are. If you are lucky enough to have a shot at the pit, which I was, DO NOT pass it up - it is truly an incomparable experience. Also, don't feel bad if you don't have tickets. There are plenty on EBAY and there are a plethora of seats available for face or less right outside !! Try and avoid the side stage seating, as the sightlines are limited. As for the show, he has never been stronger. To consider that he will be back tonight is mind-boggling from a physical perspective. The band was rockin' and, as usual, Max carried the night. Max takes Ramrod to Pluto and back. Worlds Apart was off the charts from an instrumental perspective. Max led that, too. In addition, to get Jungleland, Growin' up and Rosie in the same night just is unparalleled. I am not a DITD fan, but he is so happy to do it that I must say that I'm happy to watch him.

The weather was amazing, the pre-concert \"Meadowlands Boardwalk\" was a blast, meeting Whoopi Goldberg in the stands was real cool, blessed with a killer RoyB solo to finish out Ramrod, and then, Rosie came out! What a night! Upcoming setlists are wide open now! Look for more surprises around the corner! Dedicating \"Growin' Up\" to Eddie Vedder was pretty cool too. Pearl Jam had just ended their tour in NJ.

You can read the setlist elsewhere, but you have to take my word for this. Clarence's solo and Bruce's wailing at the end of Jungleland was pure magic. And I'm surprised no one has mentioned Into the Fire, specifically Bruce nearly breaking down while singing the last verse.

But with the triple-shot of an incredible \"Night,\" a scorching \"Candy's Room,\" and an inspired \"Prove it All Night,\" the show was brought to a whole new level. After the typical yet beautiful duo of \"Empty Sky\" and \"You're Missing,\" the acoustic guitars were all brought up front for an always fun \"Waitin' on a Sunny Day,\" topped off with that signature knee slide and, yes, hanging upside-down on the microphone stand again. \"Growin' Up\" was great to hear and done incredible well, including Bruce ending the song the same as is heard on the Live 1975-85 box set, \"It was bye-bye New Jersey, we were airborne\u2026\" The show progressed the same as Tuesday night, until Soozie Tyrell's violin opened an outstanding version of \"Jungleland.\" Clarence Clemons did a fantastic job on his saxophone solo for the song - truly one of the highlights of the first two nights. The main set ended the same as the show prior, but the encores changed very slightly. \"Hungry Heart,\" Bruce's original sing-a-long song, opened up the first encore, followed by the jaw dropping \"Ramrod\" and \"Born to Run.\" The second encore began the same way as well, but then the crowd was on edge - would he play Rosalita again? He did, and again it was a complete show-stopper. And followed by the rocking \"Dancing in the Dark,\" Bruce capped yet another great night in New Jersey. But could he top it on Friday?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>Max4858</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">My first Bruce concert was in December, 1975, and until 7/17/03, it was the best concert I've ever experienced. That all changed in Giants Stadium on a beautiful July night. This was my first ever Bruce stadium show, and I didn't know what to expect. Stupid me, I should have known what to expect, after all this was Bruce and the E Street Band in New Jersey. Great versions of The Rising and Lonesome Day to start things off, no surprise there. But then came the surprises. First, an incredible version of Night, a song I had never seen done live before. That segued into an absolutely killer version of Candy's Room, which has always been my favorite from Darkness. Followed by a kick-ass Prove it all Night, and I knew this would be no ordinary show. Empty Sky, You're Missing, and Waiting were all excellent, although the noisy, rude crowd during the slow songs was extremely annoying. And then, out of nowhere, a song \"dedicated to the old-timers out there\", Growin' Up, which just happens to be my favorite off Greetings, and another song I had never seen done live before. Everyone singing along, absolute bliss. Worlds Apart, Badlands, Mary's Place, all were great. Then came the masterpiece. The violin began, and I, along with about thirty thousand other people, yelled out deliriously \"Jungleland\". What a performance. From the violin, to Clarence nailing the sax solo, to Bruce's haunting vocal, this might have been the best performance of any Bruce song I've ever seen. No Surrender, Into the Fire, both excellent. And then came my favorite Bruce song of all time, Thunder Road. Are you freaking kidding me, Jungleland, Thunder Road, Growin' Up and Candy's Room all in the same concert, and we haven't even gotten to the encores yet??!! I closed my eyes, and felt like it was 75 all over again, and I was hearing this song for the first time. God, it was wonderful. The encores were almost anti-climatic after that. Almost. Hungry Heart live is a million times better than on The River, Ramrod was awesome, and what more needs to be said about Born to Run live. My City of Ruins and Land of Hope and Dreams are a clue that the concert is on the downside, although I love both songs, and Bruce nailed them both. Of course, Bruce had to tease us and make us think that they were the last tunes of the show. He had me going. And then came Rosie. After hearing this song at every show I saw in the 70's and 80's, I never thought I'd hear it live again. Wrong! The version was somewhat edited from the one we all know, but that didn't detract from it at all. Bruce was clearly enjoying himself, and words can't describe what it's like to hear fifty thousand people singing along to this rock anthem, and of course, all 50K knew every word. What a freaking great song, as if I needed to be reminded. Finally, Dancing in the Dark, a song I had thoroughly come to dislike in the 80's, but have to admit that I enjoyed the new rocked-out version for this tour. What a show! My favorites from 4 different albums, half of the Born to Run album (Bruce's masterpiece, IMHO), and an energy level that was amazing to behold. How old are these guys? I came all the way from Tucson Arizona for this show, and it was worth every mile and every dollar spent. And now, 28 years after seeing The Boss for the first time, I have a new favorite all-time concert. Thanks, Bruce.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Brian Mac</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Jungleland and Growin' up were the highlights of the show for me. I was at the Pearl Jam show at PNC two nights earlier when Eddie V. said Growin' up was one of his favorite songs in his youth. It was fun to hear Bruce play it also two night later. It was a beautiful summer night with Sinatra's summer winds playing while Bruce and the band took the stage. My own Jersey girl and I :) had great seats on the side of the stage with plenty of room to dance around. Jungeland was the highlight of the show for me. They played with energy and passion. This was one of my favorite shows of all time.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

The falling rain really just added to the ambience and made the performance even more special as the crowd huddled together and sang and danced all night. Opening with Who'll Stop the Rain was not a surprise, but definitely nice to hear. Ties that Bind rocked and Something in the Night was hauntingly beautiful as the rain continued to fall. You Can Look was hard-rocking and She's the One was simply breathtaking \u2014 a nice switch from the standard Out in the Streets. She's the One, with that harmonic solo at the end adds to the Bo Diddley, blues riff going on. Hope to hear it more often. Racing in the Streets was amazing and the double hit of Worlds Apart and now, Into the Fire and No Surrender are just truly impressive: nice coupling of poetic, heartfelt lyrics and some intense rocking. The encores: Cadillac Ranch was fun and 96 Tears was a real surprise, as was the fact that Bruce kept rocking with Glory Days, Detroit Medley and Born to Run. I don't know how he does it, but I'm glad he does.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Charlton</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Last night's show at Giants Stadium was my 24th Springsteen concert. I've seen him with the ESB, with the anti-ESB, and by himself. Previously, the closest I ever got to the stage was the August 1, 1999 show in which I had 14th row seats on the floor. Last night I was three rows in at the front of the pit (in between Bruce and Nils). I apologize if I seem overexuberant but it is impossible for me to quell my excitement over that experience. Despite being in a stadium with 55,000 maniacs, from my vantage point, it genuinely felt like I was in a small club. My ears are still buzzing and my legs still ache (from the hours of standing without having an opportunity to sit down) but, man, what an experience! While this piece probably appeals to only the nerd quotient of our brethren, Bruce has unknowingly maintained a seemingly impossible streak during these 24 shows. At each show, he's managed to play at least one song I had not heard previously. Last night I received four such songs. I'm not sure if Who'll Stop the Rain was on the set list (it might have been as it had been threatening to rain all day) but it was a great concert opener. While the first string of songs probably wasn't as exhilarating as the 2nd night's show (Night, Candy's Room, Prove it all Night), it was probably more adventurous. Something in the Night is a rarity that I've seen only two other times so I'm always jazzed about seeing that one. I was surprised to see You're Missing dropped from the set and NOT replaced by The River. Even though it might be the best song on the album, I think it's removal probably helped the pacing of the show. You Can Look was outstanding and a great surprise. During the call and response segment during the latter part of the song (in which Bruce is bursting out \"you can look\" and Steve is replying with \"don't touch\"), Steve changed it up to \"don't look.\" I don't know if he did that on purpose but Bruce, without missing a beat, replied with \"can't even look?\" Hilarious and classic E Street moment. In a rare moment, they missed the cue for Worlds Apart and had to restart it. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion of this song. While I've read some downright scathing reviews of it, personally, I think it sizzles. Lofgren's guitar heroics throughout are particularly impressive. Badlands is the only song from Darkness that has been played repeatedly so far but Bruce has managed to play most of the album over the course of the first three shows. I'm going to all ten, by the way, so he may actually get to the rest of it (although I'm not expecting Factory). Racing in the Street always makes the whole night worthwhile. Roy's lead on the last few minutes of the song is simply mesmerizing and stands as one of the true highlights of any Springsteen concert experience. I love the lyrics too. The whole Darkness album is remarkable but Racing is one-of-a-kind. My favorite line in all of Springsteen's work is in that song: \"now some guys they just give up living and start dying little by little, piece by piece\u2026 some guys come home from work and wash up, and go racing in the street.\" That line speaks volumes to me. With all the things in life that can whittle you down, it's critical to find that one thing that defines you and makes you want to get up the next day. For those that can't, there's no point in carrying on. Definitely one of my favorite songs. Thunder Road was dropped completely as well but the truly phenomenal, ten-song, 75-minute encore made up for it. A jubilant Cadillac Ranch kicked things off and it's always a thrill to hear that one. Ramrod is outstanding and probably is the best song for that purpose but it would nice if he would alternate it with Cadillac Ranch more often. Garland Jeffreys did a great version of 96 Tears and he genuinely seemed to be having a blast up there. A nice surprise. For all the slamming of Clarence that I've read, he's been magnificent these past couple of nights. His solo during Jungleland a couple of nights ago was dead on and his solo during Bobby Jean last night was note perfect. All hail the Big Man! Detroit Medley was a great surprise too (particularly preceding Born to Run). In fact, by the time they got to Detroit Medley, it was already the fifth song in the first encore. I was wondering if they were going to scrap Born to Run just as they did with Thunder Road. I guess Born to Run is one of those songs he just can't get away without playing. And why would anyone want to miss that one? I believe it was Pete Townsend of The Who that exclaimed, \"fucking triumph.\" Right you are, Pete! Prior to the Giants Stadium gigs, the only other time I saw Rosalita was the final night of the 11 night stand in New Jersey in '92. I was thrilled to hear it then but it's not the same as hearing the ultimate rave up with the E Street Band. He can play that one every night on this run and I would not complain. He's never written a better song for that purpose. I don't think anyone has. Absolutely tremendous. By the way, I did not offer reviews of the previous two nights (I see that many fans have) but I just wanted to take a second to comment about Prove it All Night from the 2nd night. While I've seen that song well over a dozen times, I have never seen the song played with the ferocity that was displayed on Thursday night. That was far and away the most fiery, ass kicking version of the song I've ever heard. At the climax, Springsteen was crouching to the floor polishing off the last few notes of a blistering solo while Max was literally standing erect at the drum kit smashing the hell out of it. They could have walked off the stage at that moment and I would have gone home happy. Say what you will about other cities but there is absolutely nothing in the world like seeing Bruce in Jersey.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>Scooter</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">My Second Bruce Show.

People say that he didn't Play a lot of favorites, but it doesn't matter it was still a great set. The whole concert started great with \"whole stop the rain\" under the pouring rain was genius. And with \"Mary's Place\" he was all over the place. \"Detroit Medley\" was a big surprise I'm only sixteen I don't have a big story to tell when I saw this when I was 12. But this was probably one of the best shows of the tour. I'm just pissed I was born at the wrong time. I would do anything to see a \"Darkness Show\" or a \"River Show\" or a \"USA\" Set.

I toured the Jersey shore on Thursday prior to attending the Friday evening show, just to add ambiance to my trip. You see, I came from Minneapolis to see the show. Muslims go to Mecca. I go to Jersey to see the Pope of Rock and Roll. This show was just phenomenal. The rain added to the ambiance. The setlist was awesome. I felt like a little kid. The enthusiasm standing outside the stadium was overwhelming. From the very first note, till he left the stage I was just overwhelmed. To be surrounded by 55,000 fans like myself was just crazy. I wish the night would never had ended. I apologize for not talking about the show and all the great songs, but I'm guessing those who read these postings realize that no matter what is played you can only be excited. I've read people complaining that he didn't play their favorite songs, but for someone who came a thousand miles to see the \"man\", he could have played the opening to Sesame Street and I would have stood and cheered like a 15 year old girl at an N'Sync show. This show was my sixth show from solo shows to the full band and there is nothing like seeing Bruce in the \"Promised Land\". I only wish every true fan had the opportunity to see him in Jersey. There is nothing like it and no matter what is played the experience is unforgettable. I walked away from the show with a re-energized feeling and can only wait eagerly for my next trip to the \"Promised Land\". To all those who will be seeing him over the next few months: Savor the moment and enjoy as much as I did.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>CrazyWolf</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">WOW! WOW! I had my doubts about attending the stadium shows, but Bruce immediately dispelled any reservations I had about seeing a mediocre performance. Singing, \"left us running burned and blind, chasing something in the night\" amidst the falling rain was a beautiful and chilling moment. She's the One was heart-stopping and intense \u2014 love that song. Racing in the Street was sheer poetry. Love the Rising material more and more. Lonesome Day is great to sing along to and Worlds Apart, Into the Fire and City of Ruins are gorgeous songs. What can I say? He's great! He's playing his heart out and giving all of us some of the best rock 'n' roll shows we'll ever see. Bruce and the E Street Band are without a doubt the best performance out there. Giant Stadium feels as intimate as a backyard party. Wish he'd play a month in Jersey.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>Ling Timer</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">In a single word I would sum up the show as disappointing. Keep in mind I've been seeing his shows for more than 20 years so my criticism is not from a Johnny come lately. Poor sound, a bad set list, no Thunder Road, Promised Land or Prove it all Night, made it a disappointing night. Add the rain, bad transitions between songs and you have a performance that was well below par. I would suggest to Bruce that he needs to remember he is playing in Jersey and needs to keep songs like Backstreets, 10th Ave, Fever, Fire, Because the Night, Incident on 57th, Kitty's Back etc. in the mix.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Trev Jones</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Well what is there left for me or anyone else to say about a Bruce Springsteen and the E. Street Band gig? Well here goes\u2026 It was my wife's 50th birthday so what other way to celebrate then to take her to see the Boss on his home turf in New Jersey as we live in England it was a little difficult in getting tickets but we managed and boy can I tell you all the hard work was without doubt worthwhile. We had done a couple of show's in the UK and they had been outstanding but what we got in Jersey was unbelievable. The atmosphere on the \"Boardwalk\" outside the stadium just set the concert up properly it was great to see the car park's full of people with Bar-B-Q's going and the having a great time with a few beers and some rock -n-roll music playing (this never happens outside a concert in England). Concert time arrived and the rain started to get heavier(now this does happen in England) when the Boss arrived on stage and started to sing Who'll Stop the Rain that was it I knew it was going to be one of the great nights the pace of the show once again was terrific (how he does it I will never know ) everyone was having a great time dancing and singing along from the word go. How can one man have so many show stopping songs under his belt it is unreal and probably breaks the hearts of other so called rock stars. There were many stand out songs on the night Badlands, Into the Fire, Mary's Place this ones turning into a real gem, No Surrender, Racing in the Street, Rosalita and to see him do Born To Run with the house lights on in the Giants stadium it was just amazing and something I will remember forever. If it were at all possible I would love to be there for the rest of the nights but unfortunately it is not going to happen so anyone reading this review and hesitating about catching a Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band gig don't!! just go and you will see the last great Rock band performing and if ever a man was born to Rock then his name is Bruce Springsteen. He Always thanks us for coming to the show well Bruce, Steve, Clarence, Roy, Danny, Nils, Garry, Max, Patti and Suzie I and 55,000 other in East Rutherford on that wet but very special Friday night thank you a million times for the opportunity to see you enjoying yourselves and letting us have the chance to hear your music as it should be heard.

And after strolling out to Old Blue Eyes again, the band ripped into Creedence Clearwater's \"Who'll Stop the Rain,\" well worth getting soaked. After the standard \"Rising\" \"Lonesome Day\" combo, the band kicked into an incredible version of \"The Ties that Bind,\" followed by \"My Love Will Not Let You Down.\" Bruce was certainly in top form tonight! But the biggest surprise thus far had to be the incredible \"Something in the Night,\" a true rarity from the Boss. \"You're Missing\" was dropped after \"Empty Sky,\" and \"Waitin' on a Sunny Day\" moved right in - this actually worked a little better for the rainy, stadium atmosphere. The next four songs back to back had to be one of the best rock moments of the stand to that point, with an incredible quadruple shot of \"You Can Look,\" \"World's Apart,\" \"Badlands,\" and the show stopping \"She's the One.\" Although \"Out in the Street\" works incredible well as a stadium sing-a-long, there may not be a song Bruce does live that tops the hard-pounding rendition of \"She's the One.\" \"Mary's Place\" was followed by yet another highlight, the rare yet beautiful \"Racing in the Street.\" The song's three minute closing instrumental is one of the more touching moments in rock 'n' roll, as the whole band unites for an incredible sound and effect. The main set ending similarly to the first two shows, but did not include \"Thunder Road.\" And then, it got even better! In what was possibly the greatest encore of the stand, Bruce whipped out \"Cadillac Ranch\" to start, followed by the ? and the Mysterians hit \"96 Tears\" with special guest Garland Jeffreys. \"Bobby Jean\" followed, and then \"Glory Days\" made it's first appearance of the stand to audience satisfaction. \"Born to Run\" time? Not yet. Bruce and the band cut into a short but great \"Detroit Medley,\" followed by the rock anthem. The second encore proved to be the same as the first two nights, but was not a let down. \"Rosie\" and \"Dancing\" still brought the house down, and \"My City of Ruins\" continued to be a tear jerker. The one real problem has to \"Land of Hope and Dreams,\" a song that Bruce has played every night since the Reunion Tour. Although some may real like the song, it tends to drag quite a bit and just isn't the type of song that can be played night after night. If Bruce wants to make his public service announcement, that's perfectly fine, but follow it up with a rocking \"Born in the USA\" or something to that fashion. That would certainly add an extra jolt to the final encore. Otherwise, Friday night's show was undoubtedly the best of the opening trio. What would Monday bring?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Mark</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">All I can say is WOW!!! the rarities just kept comin!!!

It actually made it more fun and Bruce seemed to feed off that extra energy from the crowd. As for Bruce's energy, he just simply amazes me - he and the band keep getting better, night after night after night. As do the song selections - Night, For You, Spirit (nice to see Mad Dog), Trapped, Where the Bands Are, and of course an absolutely ear splitting, stadium rocking Rosie. If you don't have tix, get them. The big stadium doesn't take away from the Bruce experience.

Jackson Cage, Prove it all Night and Trapped were terrific songs to get the crowd going. Along the way, some oldies, For You and Spirit in the Night \u2014 both were nailed beautifully. Cadillac Ranch went into rockabilly-country overdrive with Soozie joining in the jam \u2014 awesome. And the rain, waiting until Mary's Place, well, a perfect moment for some of that rock 'n' roll gospel to come down and liberate us all. Great show, but my favorite, so far, night #3.

This was going to be a great night! I had General Admission for the show and wound up about three rows back in the sea of people. When the band took the stage, sheer amazement ran through my body - there I was fifteen feet away from my idols. It was going to be a night to remember. \"The Rising\" and \"Lonesome Day\" opened up the show, not \"Who'll Stop the Rain,\" which many thought would. In fact, the CCR classic stayed tucked away all night. But the surprise of \"Jackson Cage\" surely made up for it. After great versions of \"Night\" and \"Prove it all Night,\" one of the songs I've always wanted to hear was finally played, \"Trapped.\" The vocals on the song were incredible, as the band harmonized extremely well, sending those words through my body like nothing else. Again \"You're Missing\" was nowhere to be found, but was once again made up for with the surprise \"For You\" making its first appearance in some time. \"The Promised Land\" followed , with the typical trio of \"World's Apart,\" \"Badlands,\" and \"Out in the Street\" following the action. \"Mary's Place\" was next, with Bruce accentuating the \"Let in rain\" chorus. At this point it was really coming down out there, and Bruce gave us a song to \"keep us moving.\" \"Cadillac Ranch\" rocked as usual, followed by the always great and inspired \"Into the Fire.\" Bruce's vocals on the final verse of the song bring it full circle and exude the emotion that the speaker of the song is trying to convey. After \"No Surrender\" closed the main set, the band came back out for the encores. However, it seemed that Max had changed a little during the break. Well, there was a reason for that, it wasn't Max at all! It was Vini \"Mad Dog\" Lopez, of the original E Street Band, coming out to lend his hand on the classic \"Spirit in the Night.\" During one part where Bruce let the crowd start the next verse, Vini's face lit up like it was the most amazing thing he had ever seen. Imagine, a song you helped out on thirty years ago now being sung by 55,000 faithful. It was truly a moment that would give goosebumps to anyone. But it was also around this point that it became obvious to me how difficult GA was. After standing for nearly six hours at this point, the body was beginning to seriously fatigue. Not only this but the downpouring of rain didn't help either. However, it loosened up Bruce, and able-bodied or not, it was destined to continue to be a great night. The incredibly-rare \"Where the Bands Are\" popped up next, followed by a solid \"Bobby Jean.\" The great duo of \"Ramrod\" and \"Born to Run\" followed. During \"Ramrod\" I threw dice on stage, but before any band member could get to them, a cameraman took them away to the sound of some boos from the crowd (a small victory). But these songs were even more fun from this close. Watching the entire stadium's hands raised during the middle of \"Born to Run\" was something I'll never forget. The second encore was finally shook up a little, with \"Hungry Heart\" played after yet another great performance of \"Rosalita.\" \"Dancing in the Dark\" once again closed the show, but it was enough. Twenty-seven songs and an incredibly energetic performance, not to mention being 15 feet from my idol, well, it was one of the greatest nights I can recall. But believe me, the two day break until the next show was going to be very necessary.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Some nice surprises last night: Streets of Fire was hauntingly intense and it was great to hear She's the One again \u2014 never get tired of that song and Bruce and band are playing it with more ferocity and more of a true blues riff/feel that far surpasses the reunion tour version! Great double shot of Meeting and Jungleland. Out beneath the stars on a summer night, Jungleland is, although heartbreaking and hauntingly apocalyptic, overwhelmingly beautiful at the same time. A rocking, cajun-country revve up of Working on the Highway was a treat and Sandy was definitely nice to hear. Can he rock any harder on Prove it? Blistering version \u2014 Bruce and Max are out of control on that one. Waiting for Incident and Price You Pay.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Kyle Pucciarello</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Reuniting with Tom Cantillon (of Greasy Lake review fame) for our third show of the run together was something I was very much looking forward to. Unfortunately I was not feeling too well with a bad stomach bug. However, I took my Pepto Bismol and I stuck it out, ready to take whatever Bruce had to offer (as long as it didn't rain again). And finally we had a dry night! \"The Promised Land\" kicked open the festivities, with the usual \"Rising\" and \"Lonesome Day\" following it up. But then possibly the biggest surprise of the run was played - \"Streets of Fire!\" For only the second time since the Darkness tour this gem was played with incredible intensity, just the way I had hoped when both Tom and I requested it in a letter to Bruce. \"My Love\" was next with Max's incredible drumwork at the forefront. \"Prove it all Night\" was next, with a new guitar solo at the end where Bruce, Little Steven and Nils Lofgren all jam together until the song's end. After the predictable but still enjoyable \"Empty Sky\" + \"Waitin'\" combo, the crowd was treated to another surprise - \"Working on the Highway.\" But this was a little different, with Clarence appearing in washboard as well as an incredible violin solo from Soozie at song's end. After \"Worlds\" and \"Badlands,\" we once again got the blistering \"She's the One,\" which is always a concert favorite of mine. The harmonica solo at the end of the song is an incredible addition to the song, making it an absolute gem to hear. \"Mary's Place\" was fun as usual, but would be no match for what would come after. Garry W. Tallent brought out the standup bass for the rare \"Meeting Across the River,\" which of course signals for \"Jungleland\" directly after - absolutely stunning. The main set then closed as it had been with \"Into the Fire\" leading into a great \"No Surrender.\" The end of song is electrifying with Bruce and Nils squaring off for a guitar solo, and then Max's great drum work and the guitars breaking the song down to a close. \"Sandy\" opened up the first encore as a real treat, followed by the incredible \"Ramrod\" and \"Born to Run.\" The second encore was the same as it has been, and was the only disappointment (if you could even call it that). Changing the final encore up a little bit each night would not be a bad idea. Of course he is playing to the fans who have tickets to only the one show, and not just the die-hards who have tickets to each show, but switching them up would not be a bad idea. It amazes me how he never gets tired of the same four songs, especially the dragging and lacking \"Land of Hope and Dreams.\" But, on a high note, the closing duo of \"Rosie\" and \"Dancing\" continue to be impressive and energetic. Show number five shows that Bruce just gets better and better. And now comes the first real weekend shows\u2026</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Opening w/\"Adam Raised a Caine\" - what can you say but\u2026unbelievable. And \"Ties That Bind\", \"Two Hearts\" and \"Glory Days\" had the crowd up. \"Born to Run\", \"Badlands\", \"Promised Land\", \"Tenth Avenue Freeze Out\" and \"Rosalita\" of course were major highlights but one of my favorites, \"Darlington County\" was right up there, too. \"Into The Fire\" and other Rising Songs geared towards 9/11 were extremely moving and well received by the crowd and \"Mary's Place\" was even better this time than on opening night. Two songs that are growing on me after the 2 shows I've seen are \"Waitin' On A Sunny Day\" and \"Dancin' In The Dark\" - always liked them but something about how they come off as a concert song has given them a new \"look\" for me\u2026 I can't remember which song (shame on me) that Bruce, Nils and Little Steven all took a turn at brief solos, but all were on fire, to say the least. No special guests except for the fans (and my kids) who nailed every word of every song. (oh, yeah - unnamed members of the Sopranos were somewhere in the audience) and one moment worth mentioning was when the crowd, after Bruce dubbed them the \"greatest house band in the land\", began chanting \"E Street Band, E Street Band\". Perfect weather, 55,000+ fans and the greatest house band in the land was on fire.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Tom Cantillon</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Night 6: Opening with Adam Raised the Cain was unbelievable. Intense, ferocious performance. Ties and Atlantic City were equally good. Darlington County helped to keep things rocking, but switching No Surrender earlier, rather than after Into the Fire, I felt did not work. My Hometown, expected, sort of brought things to a halt. Bruce needed something more powerful after Mary's Place, to feed off that energy-Backstreets, or something more grand like Incident. The nights he played Jungleland seemed to have worked the best so far. Tenth Ave. was a great way to kick off the encores \u2014 he should play that more often in encore set and drop Hungry Heart. On a different note, if people are going to go to the show and do nothing but complain the entire time about what he's playing-then just stay home! There are dozens of songs we'd all like to hear, but Bruce and band are still playing with a passion and intensity that far exceeds any other performer. Appreciate the shows \u2014 they're great and no better way to spend summer in Jersey. Also, why aren't people more into, Into the Fire? It's a song that so closely hits home and is a beautiful tribute to all the heroes on that fateful day. I love that song and when Bruce sings the last verse with the anguish in his voice, it's an overwhelming moment. Should not be a beer break song. Stay and pay tribute to the fallen and departed, they deserve it. And so does Bruce for having written such a beautiful song. It is one of the most soul-wrenching moments of the entire show and should not be so easily dismissed. So is My City of Ruins \u2014 great live song \u2014 leaves me with chills. Well, night 6 from the 6th row was pretty intense and a great show despite it's brevity. Favorite so far \u2014 7/18 night three.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>Same Ole Played Out Scenes</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">This was perhaps the most uninspired effort I have seen from Bruce since he was playing off Shayne Fontayne and being pelted with dice. What is up with this set list? He gets off to a rockin' start with \"Adam Raised the Cain\", and keeps it up pretty well with \"Ties\" and \"Atlantic City\", but do we really have to endure Worlds Apart anymore? This song should have been left of the mediocre Rising CD, and certainly has no place amongst the pantheon of Springsteen greats. With things like \"Kitty's Back\" and \"Night\" in the arsenal, he chooses to ram \"My Hometown\" and Tenth Ave down our throat. By the way, yesterday was my birthday; I turned 35, and I have a boy of my own now, and I STILL didn't want to hear My Hometown. Judging by the amount of people who were suddenly hit with 15 thousand simultaneous urges to take a wizz, I wasn't the only one who didn't need to hear it. And after the last tour, I don't need to hear two songs ever again live: \"Tenth\" and \"Light of Day\". Throw in \"Glory Days\" and \"Darlington County\" (which I liked up until about 9:30 last night), this show was a complete dud. I can sit through the opportunistic 9/11 BS, complete with its Sesame Street-like anthem \"Waiting on a Sunny Day\" ('Ice cream truck on a deserted street'???? C'mon!) I can listen to the limo liberal rant about Bush (who I happen to not care for as well,) I can put up with his being for the 'working man' schtick as he stuffs 1.8M per show (PER SHOW!!!) in his pocket while asking the very same working man to pony up about 220 bucks to take his wife to the show ($75 per ticket, 40 for a babysitter, 15 for parking and 30 more for 2 beers each) in the worst possible venue, (the good seats are 40-60 yards from the stage). But I CANNOT put up with all that and hear such a fluffy, mindless, run of the mill set list that was cut short and was at best terrible, and at worst, a complete bore. My run of Springsteen shows (now numbering over 40) is officially over. Save for the occasional Christmas Show, where I can see a REAL set list, I think I'll spend my money on things that helps the real blue collar troubadours.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Kyle Pucciarello</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Finally a weekend show had arrived. Initially this was the only show that I didn't have, but I picked up two good tickets for half-off and decided that I really wanted to make it a perfect 10 for the Giants Stadium run. I brought with me on this night a friend who had never seen Bruce before but who had always wanted to. He wouldn't be disappointed. Opening with \"Adam Raised a Cain\" had to be the most energetic opening of the tour - absolutely incredible. The usual two-pack of \"Rising\" and \"Lonesome Day\" were followed with a wonderful \"Ties that Bind\" and the second surprise of the night, \"Atlantic City.\" The way this song has transformed from an acoustic ballad on Springsteen's 1980 album \"Nebraska\" to the rocker it is now is one of Springsteen's great accomplishments in terms of reworking a song. \"Empty Sky\" and \"Waitin'\" were nice as always, and a great rendition of \"Darlington County\" kept the crowd going, the little crowd that was actually into the show. Although the show was sold out, the one problem with the Saturday show was that many seemed to be either too drunk to actually enjoy the show or were just casual fans there to talk and see just what the Boss had to offer live. This of course did not bode well for the hardcore fans, and it seemed to affect how Bruce finished out the rest of show. After the expected but always welcome \"World's Apart\" + \"Badlands\" duo, a surprise \"Two Hearts\" was played in the spot usually taken over by \"Out in the Street\" or \"She's the One.\" Another surprise came in the fact that \"No Surrender\" was played next, and not saved for the final song of the main set. \"Mary's Place\" was followed with a very nice \"My Hometown,\" which although may have brought the energy down after a rocking \"MP,\" was still done wonderfully. The always great \"Into the Fire\" was followed by \"The Promised Land,\" which ended the main set. So far so good on Saturday night. The first encore opened with \"10th Avenue Freeze Out,\" a song that I had been waiting to hear for the entire stand and was very pleased to finally do so. The song was great, and a real pleasure over the elongated version from the Reunion Tour. \"Glory Days\" followed with \"Born to Run\" not far behind, and the first encore was complete. The second encore remained the same, with \"Rosalita\" again being the standout and still remaining one of the most enjoyable points of the show. But again, the lack of spontaneity in this second encore is something that continues to confuse me. Although the show was a little short, it was overshadowed with the fact that my friend had never experienced anything better than this, his first, Bruce concert. Seeing the smile on his face and listening to him sing the songs on the way home was enough to make this yet another special night.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Don Ochs</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">The Bruce Springsteen I love plays every show like his life depends on it. The Bruce Springsteen I saw at Giant's Stadium seemed to realize he was playing to the same comfortable, built-in audience that will support endless shows in the same place. Certainly the variations in the setlist were nice. I've always wanted to hear Kitty, and the Conan show raised my awareness of that song last year. And It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City takes me back a few years. Don't get me wrong, since I'll see Bruce more than once on a tour. But I really feel that Springsteen is resting on his laurels and is too comfortable with his built in followers. It feels as if he's playing more to a Star Trek convention than to a rock and roll crowd. Why should he challenge himself if he knows he has an audience who will see him at any price under any circumstance. Heck, why not just set up shop in Vegas and be like Elvis, Wayne Newton and Celine?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Kae</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">This was a day that would either destroy or fulfill a legend for me. It was my first ever Bruce show. In my defense, I'm only 16. Nevertheless, while the show wasn't the best (the setlist being a little lackluster, Giants Stadium being perhaps a little too impersonal a venue) I, unlike others who've submitted reports, did not fail to appreciate Bruce and the Band's effort. How can you? Why is James Brown the hardest working man in show biz? Anyone who's seen Bruce sliding across the stage, hopping up on that piano, running all over the place and \u2014 the best \u2014 doing that crazy mic stand/head stand thing \u2014 he obviously works the hardest! There is such a brotherhood amongst the band members. Like it's the coolest fraternity you could ever join. It's now October, after I've seen him at Shea, and I see now that the show wasn't the greatest \u2014 but it was worth it and it will always be dear to me as my first.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Saint in the City kept things rolling all the way through the most visceral, rockin', redemptive Mary's Place I've seen so far\u2014becoming one of my concert favorites. Backstreets was amazing and should definitely be played more often judging from the crowd's reaction. Encore time was a wild, rockin' time with a blistering Kitty's Back, intense Born to Run, a celebratory Rosie and an over-the-top performance of Seven Nights to Rock with Bruce belting out that tune and dropping to the floor only to pop back up and continue singing. I left the show high and exhausted and wanting more. Easily the best of the 7 night stand. There is no question in my mind that Bruce and E St Band are the best live performance to hit the stage. I don't know how he does it night after night, but I for one, am totally grateful and in awe.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Gregg</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">I was disappointed. I've seen him many times (including opening night at Giants Stadium this time) and I felt this was a really disjointed show. He usually has a theme running through his shows. Beginning of the Rising tour (911), reunion tour (brotherhood), Tunnel of Love tour (dealing with love) etc. Nothing here. He seemed to be picking songs out of a hat and then doing them. Stage would darken and then he would go into a new song. None of his excellent weaving of songs together. His performance of each song is excellent, but rote. It's hard to knock a guy for putting on a show like this but you always expect the best from Springsteen because he's set such a standard. I look forward to when he is back in arenas.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Kevin McDevitt</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">\"It's a good, hot night. We've been waiting for one of these!\" It was a good, hot night. No stars, but no rain until we were told (after 23 songs) that \"We'll see you in August\". This was the first time I'd been to a show since last summer, having been to the opener in NJ and then again in Las Vegas. I have to admit, I was verry disappointed in the shows at the beginning of the tour. This show was the exact opposite. The best way to describe it - take the best parts of the Reunion Tour and mix them with the best songs from the new album and *poof*, magic. Candy, Kitty, Rosie, and the Saint in the City. Meeting across the River into Backstreets; and a favorite staple from the RT: Badlands (still the most ferocious live song ever) into Out in the Street. Everyone looked great and sounded great (The Big Man's timing may have been off once or twice, but Bruce didn't seem to mind, so why should we?) All in all, it was a great, great night. I'd never been to a stadium show before, and had reservations about the atmosphere, but they went out the window 30 seconds into Downbound Train. Bruce had a lot of juice, working both sides of the stage, flirting with his wife, and playing with the boys in the band (and his mic stand!). Who else is making great and relevant Rock 'n Roll at the age of Fifty-something? We all know the answer to that one.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Jim Mitchell</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">OK, so an off night for Bruce Springsteen is still something fantastic and memorable. But this concert just didn't do much for me. Bruce seemed very tired, the setlist, while interesting, was too short, and the band just didn't seem to be terribly into the show. If it's possible for Bruce to be \"going through the motions\", this was it. I believe he's overextended himself with the stadium shows- they're just too big, it's too hot, and the tour has gone on for too long (and it hasn't been THAT long since the very similar Reunion tour). While I certainly enjoyed myself, the best way to I can put it is that this is the first Springsteen show of my 11 since 1988 that I didn't walk away from feeling overwhelmed. I would have thought this impossible for a Springsteen concert, but here it is. Kitty's Back is one of those songs that I feel like I should enjoy, but then realize that that's pretentious and just accept that I don't really care for it. Same with Candy's Room and Saint in the City. Just not Bruce at his best. While complaining about a show being too short is like complaining about not getting enough toys at Christmas, I think Bruce sets up expectations that he can't always live up to. 23 songs at a Springsteen concert is not that many by his standards. I don't think it's unreasonable to feel a bit disappointed when that's what you get. I really don't think that these stadium shows will be cited as a highlight of Bruce's career- seems like he's going more for the numbers than for anything really artistic. Oh well- one more in Milwaukee, and I'll call it a tour.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Dave Powers</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">There I was sitting in Sec 313 st the top of the meadowlands.

Additionally, I had been to the Monday and Thursday shows at the stadium earlier in the week, and this one just wasn't exploding with E Street power like the others. Its got to be expected given the length of the tour\u2026. one has to think Big Jon and the Boss should have taken that into consideration when booking these things.

Unfortunately, this meant that Bruce was leaving New Jersey, and I don't think anyone was ready for that. And after tonight, that notion was certainly solidified. \"Downbound Train,\" although a slow opener, was incredible and was a real treat to hear. Bruce's voice was at its peak, and this was surely going to be a show to remember. \"The Rising\" and \"Lonesome Day\" were great as always, but somehow especially so on this night. The atmosphere was right, the fans were all very much into the show, it was just one of those nights where everything was right. And I don't think I have gotten into a show as much as this one - I needed something to savor for the next month after all. \"Candy's Room\" was again a treat to hear, as was the rocking \"Prove it all Night,\" with that guitar solo at the end sounding more inspired every night. Then of course came the beautiful \"Empty Sky\" followed by the incredible fun \"Waitin' on a Sunny Day,\" that microphone bit just never got old - lots of fun. \"It's Hard to be a Saint in the City\" was next, and was another one of the songs I just couldn't go the run without hearing. Besides being an absolutely phenomenal song, Roy's piano solo at the end gets my vote for one of the most incredible live moments of the tour (in Atlantic City it was also amazing). Roy and Max are undoubtedly the backbone of the E Street Band musically, but somehow always get overlooked. Spending seven nights in a row with these guys it was obvious that, while all are incredible musicians in their own right, it's these two guys who hold it together night after night. \"World's Apart\" was next with that guitar solo that shows the band's versatility, with Van Zandt, Lofgren and Springsteen all trading riffs. \"Badlands\" followed as usual, and as always, was just fun to be a part of. The energy exchange between Bruce and the crowd during this song is something that really cannot be duplicated. \"Out in the Street\" followed and was fun to hear once again. The crowd participation and energy really makes the song what it is in a stadium atmosphere. \"Mary's Place\" followed and the same follows for it - the crowd makes it one of the most pleasing songs in concert. But then came the real treats. Garry's bass came out again for \"Meeting Across the River,\" once again great to hear. Now when one hears the song, they immediately link it to \"Jungleland,\" the song that usually follows it in concert. However, tonight would not be one of those nights, and \"Backstreets\" came as a complete surprise to everyone in the house - but quite possibly one of the most welcome. \"No Surrender\" closed the main set, but without the song it is usually linked to, \"Into the Fire.\" This marked the first time the song was dropped during this tour, but it was missed a little. \"Into the Fire\" really exemplifies what \"The Rising\" is all about, and if these concerts are still supposed to be showcasing the album, then dropping the song was not the smartest idea. After a main set that was unlike any other, what more could the crowd expect? Well whatever they were expecting, they got more. \"Kitty's Back\" opened the first encore to thunderous reception and absolutely brought the house down. This has to be one of Springsteen's greatest accomplishments, and it was written when he was just twenty-three years old. The classic rocker was followed by a fun \"Bobby Jean.\" But the encore was completed with the rocking \"Born to Run,\" seemingly more inspired tonight and done exceptionally well as always. \"My City of Ruins\" started the encores as usual, and was once again dedicated to the community food band and Asbury Park. The song is one of the most beautiful Springsteen has penned, and continues to please at concerts. When he gets to the second \"C'mon rise up\u2026\" verse, the crowd all rises - it really is something to be a part of. \"Land of Hope and Dreams\" once again took the next spot in the second encore, and again brought things down (at least for me) a little. But, fear not, \"Rosalita\" was here to save the day, and again was absolutely phenomenal. How great was it to hear that song seven shows in a row? \"Dancing in the Dark\" followed to a thunderous reception, but would this be all? Were the seven nights finished already? Not just yet! Springsteen thanked the crowd for coming to the shows and for their continued support, and rewarded them with the great \"Seven Nights to Rock,\" a very fitting way to end the legendary run. After all of the anticipation for the seven night run, and the shows that followed, it was already over. It's amazing how quickly this run was over, but it will be replayed again and again in my head (and maybe through the help of some bootlegs). This was truly one of the most memorable experiences I've had, and it was great to share them with some great people. All we can say as fans is - thank you Bruce!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Steve</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">This was show # 5 for me on this current stand &amp; the energy level from the crowd was so high , so loud &amp; just made this show one to remember.

During this night we got a rare Kitty's back, Meeting across the river right into Backstreets &amp; also another oldie but goodie Hard to be a saint. This may have to be the best, hardest working &amp; tightest backing band ever to be put together . Cant wait till august 30th &amp; the 31st\u2026\u2026\u2026.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Bruce and band ripped into Promised Land, The Rising and Prove it. But it was during Darlington County that I think everything really just fell into place and made for a very powerful, focused and rockin' show, one of the best of this tour. Backstreets was passionately performed and backing it with Into the Fire and No Surrender made for one of the most intense, poetic, heartbreaking, rocking moments of the tour. Together, they are a powerful trio that work so well and should be played more often in that sequence. Encore time: Unbelievable! One of the strongest, most overwhelming encore sets I've seen. Started things off with a rollicking, country-tinged Mystery Train, dedicated to Sam Phillips, followed by a party-time Tenth Ave. and Ramrod. Next, came one of those moments you hope turns up on cd somewhere. As Bruce finished a blistering Born to Run, he kept the band holding the final note as he stood there, clutching his guitar and shaking his head, urging the band to maintain that intensity until he was ready to launch into an over-the-top performance of Seven Nights!! Amazing! One of those completely, awe-inspiring moments of a Springsteen concert. Great show from start to finish.

I had a ticket with my friend's brother up on the second deck the first night and my tickets for the next night were just a hop and a skip below those, in the lower section. Little did I know, however, as I laced up my boots and wrapped my head in my bandana and Red Sox hat, that my ticket in the upper deck was no longer mine.

And then my friend said something I thought I'd never hear, ever. \"Yea, you're coming down into the pit with me and my cousin.\" HOLY @#(%&amp; !~@(# &amp;!(#&amp; ! #(&amp;% &amp;!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was still in shock as we went through the gates and onto the field where in just a month or so I would be watching my beloved Patriots battle it out on the gridiron\u2026 I was still in shock as I walked past row upon row of seats streaming across the floor of the stadium, knowing that somehow, I was lucky enough to have even better seats then they\u2026 I was still in shock as I looked up, came to, and saw merely ten feet in front of me, the microphone, covered in protective plastic (the elements were in splendid form for this one\u2026) where Bruce Springsteen would soon be playing. As the first notes on the harmonica rang out at the beginning of \"Promised Land\", I knew we were in for a hard rocking night, or what felt like seven for that matter. The Band freight-trained their way through some of my most favorites, like \"No Surrender\", \"Darlington County\", and what I felt was the highlight of the show, \"Backstreets.\" Bruce was amazingly loose, joking about the fog on \"Ramrod\". \"Stevie, is it quitting time yet? I can't see shit!!\" Donning Clarence's hat, hanging from the mic stand, and flirting shamelessly with Patti. On three separate occasions Bruce pointed directly at my friends and I, making eye contact. Certainly made us feel like we were doing our part as fans, giving our all to feed back to Bruce what we were so lucky to take from him. All in all, what a couple of nights. And though I didn't have pit tix for Saturday's show, I wasn't any less into or satisfied. Bruce, I guess, is just like that.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Mark</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">This was my second Boss concert and I was disappointed. That pains me to admit that but that is how I feel. I had seats, at literally, the back-top of the stadium. I felt so far away from the show that it put a damper on things. I was one of the many taking bathroom breaks during the SEVERAL slow songs he played. I should have listened to The Rising though before seeing this show. To be fair, though, there were several memorable performances and people generally seemed to enjoy themselves. I will never again see a concert from so far away.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

It was an all out go for broke show and the crowd was feeding off the music and the band was feeding off the crowd. It seemed that Bruce didn't want the show to end which would explain the extra long version of Dancing in the dark, he just kept it going and no-one was going to leave! But all good things must end at some point, so at around 11:40 it was done.. The only knock on the evening I have was the starting time.. The tickets said 7:30 not 8:25..

The fact that at least two local radio stations were playing Bruce A-Z all weekend would lead one to believe this was going to be a very special show. As it turns out, Bruce wound up wasting twenty-five songs on a lifeless stadium full of stiffs. Never before have I seen the Boss play to a crowd so much with so little return. As he coaxed the fans with repeated \"c'mon Philly\" pleas during an awesome \"Out in the Street\" the Philadelphians were barely able to stop yawning long enough to respond. Later, during the usually epic rendition of Mary's Place, Bruce once again attempted to arouse the masses and eventually backed off, commenting to Clarence that this wasn't the Philly that he knew. Great show. Crappy crowd.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Ray C.</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Bruce and the boys came up with another classic performance to open Lincoln Financial Field to concerts in Philly. Bruce put his special green Philly shirt(\"if you see a picture of me with this shirt, you know I was in Philly\") and jammed the night away with great classics like Sherry Darling, Out In The Streets, Promised Land while the best surprise being Lost in The Flood with the full band behind him. Worth the price of admission itself to even the hardcore fan. The songs from the Rising are sounding better than ever and you can tell Bruce and the band are having fun doing them.

What an honor for The City of Brotherly Love to have Bruce for their first act! Although I'm a former Jersey Girl ( and I have to admit the the crowd was more responsive at my last show in Giants Stadium on 7/21) the Philly show ROCKED! Bruce pulled out all the stops with his tried and true set list, plus some neat twists like Sherry Darling and Seven Days A Week. His gospel-esque intro of the band during Mary's Place, was funny and heartfelt at the same time and he went out of his way to play up to the Philadelphia crowd, by saying things like he wore his special green sequined shirt in honor of the Eagles (whose home stadium he was opening). Bruce seemed to shine through as the nice guy that all his fans claim he is and even gave a wave and a casual hello to waiting fans as he exited the backstage area into his car (the stadium is set up so that one section can see the opening of the stage on the side and I was lucky enough to be there as he left). All in all, this show was definitely on par with the Jersey date I saw and thought nothing would rival. Fans around me still thought there was too much emphasis on The Rising songs and wanted more classic stuff, but it's such an amazing album that how can he not play it? One surprising absence to note though was no Atlantic City or Streets of Philadelphia which just beg to be played in this venue. Still, I don't know how he does it night after night\u2014the energy, and pure joy he shows on stage were absolutely contagious.

The crowd was into it the whole way-even during some of the lesser known Rising songs. This was the best Ramrod to date and I can't understand why Sherry Darling is not an every night song.

(just a thought.) The green LSD shirt was also worn and he commented on it before Empty Sky\u2026 something to the effect of he only wears it in Philly, and if you ever see a picture of him in that shirt, then you know it must be Bruce in Philly. Bruce was loser than I've ever seen him during a great version of Sherry Darling. He was dancing all around, took out some maracas and danced with them; it was really a lot of fun. Lost in the Flood very well may have been the best live song I've ever heard\u2026 it was so incredibly powerful and the best I've heard it on any studio or boot or anything\u2026 it was just absolutely mind-boggling Ramrod also worked very well as usual the chemistry on stage between Bruce and Steve is great to watch and something no one can ever bore of. At the end of Born to Run, Bruce made the band hold that final note for what seemed to be 5 minutes, but was probably only about 1 or 2\u2026 but it was great because the crowd was so energetic as the band went into\u2026 Seven Nights to Rock was also great as usual\u2026 seems like more fans are learning the lyrics and it was the best audience reaction I've seen (out of the 3 times I've heard it live).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Karen</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">The first concert on Friday night was great. Bruce did lesser known songs off the river like Sherry darling and Out in The Streets. He also did My Love Will Not Let You Down. I have to admit that the crowd was out of it though. The sound also left a lot to be desired. His commentary was muffled and lyrics inaudible. But still a great show.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">John Grosso</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Any apprehension I had on whether Bruce would be able to play a stadium venue was quickly dismissed the second Bruce counted-off, reached into his back pocket, and started into 'Promised Land' with a beautiful harmonica note. A truly wonderful opening track, which followed the 1963 Orions hit 'South Street' over the PA system. Both 'The Rising' and 'Lonesome Day' came across very strong in the new home of the Philadelphia Eagles. Overall, the sound was excellent - strong, clear and loud - a vast improvement from the 1985 Vet Stadium shows. I was a little disappointed in the selection of 'My Love Will Not Let You Down', until the band simply gave this song their all. Max, in particular, was very strong on this one. 'Something in the Night' was remarkable. A stellar performance of a very under-rated song. Bruce's vocals hung in the air, and every note, esp. the near-ending guitar part was perfect!!!!!! The performance of this song alone was well worth the price of admission. Next treat - 'Sherry Darling'. Came across very well - loose, but the band's timing was perfect, and it definitely appeared Bruce was enjoying playing this one. I really have a mixed reaction to 'World's Apart'. First reaction is - why are we still playing this? - but, you could see towards the end of the track how it does appear Bruce and the Band enjoy performing this. Badlands\u2026\u2026 stellar as usual. 'Out in the Street' came across very nice with a wonderful 'South Street Improv' which carried nicely into 'Mary's Place'. (I really missed the improv and lead-in on Saturday). 'Mary's Place' was nailed perfectly, between Bruce, the E Street Band and the crowd. 'Lost in the Flood' (full band) was a true 'Oh, My God' moment!!!! The sound of this track just resonated beautifully throughout Linc Field. Another 'Show, and in my opinion, Tour' Highlight!!!! 'No Surrender' was a nice treat to finish the main set, and again, similar to 'My Love' was nailed by the Band, esp. Max. First Encore - both the performance and the selections were wonderful. 'Night' came across extremely well and 'Born to Run' leading into 'Seven Nights' should be done like this every night. \"Seven Nights\" is a classic performance. Second Encore - pretty standard now, except, the Philly crowd was definitely anticipating 'Rosie' which opened with a bit of an old 'improv' which quickly lead into the song'. 'My machines all done, stuck in the mud, Somewhere in the Swamps of New Jersey', probably brought the loudest cheer from the crowd all night. A number of times throughout the Show Bruce referenced this being the opening in 'your nice new stadium', and the couple of references to 'South Street' were really nice touches. All in all a truly wonderful show in a beautiful new venue. Any question would be still performing 9 tracks from the Rising is a little much - 13 months after the album's release - and maybe instead of 'You're Missing', 'World's Apart' and 'Into the Fire', we could have gotten 'Further On', 'The Fuse', and how about 'Paradise'?</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

A few songs later, he played \"Night\" which is great live. Bruce said \"we're going to chase away the Monday blues\" so I had a feeling I was in for a great night. Later, it was great to hear \"Darlington County\" which is a rarity. The remainder of the show was great with a great mix of old and new songs.

Then \"I'm Going Down\" rocked the house. Later in the show, he sang Pretty Flamingo so tenderly you knew he could only be talking about one person: \"ROSALITA!! What a great lead in for that song.

I have a recording of Dave Edmonds doing it, but this is my first time hearing the song done by its author, Bruce Springsteen. What a great way to open a fabulous show. This is one of the best Bruce performances I've ever seen. Second only to his 9-24-99 show at the Spectrum. Bruce even had us howling at the moon at one point.

Honestly, this show has moved me in ways never imagined! I took my little brother (he is 18 and this was his second show), I am 25 and it was my 12th. I could not be more happy to have shared this experience with him and to welcome him to the religion of \"Brucism\". Hearing \"Incident\" live was an absolute thrill! Bruce and the band had an energy I haven't seen before! Their sound was so sharp and tight\u2026from the Professors jams on the piano, to Max banging the drums with all he had, to Suzie rockin' out on the violin\u2026it was a musical spectacular! I stood there, for three hours feeling like I was one of the luckiest people in the world to understand, and fully \"get\" what this band stands for, what these shows mean, each one holding a new memory and moment in time\u2026 I truly feel like being a Springsteen fan gives me meaning in this world, and a show like 8/11/03 is only further proof to that.

He was amazing and the E. Street Band was tight and right on. The setlist was supreme. I admire his talent and energy more each and every time I see him. I was also impressed to see a whole new generation of Springsteen fans rocking to the old and the new stuff.

When Bruce opened up with From Small Things I knew we were in for a treat. There is no better place to see Bruce than Philly. Bruce was having the time of his life tonight. Howling at the moon on Ramrod playing Incident and Going Down based on requests from the audience. This goes down as one of my top two Bruce shows with the other being his 50th Birthday show at the Spectrum.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>xnyerinsf</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">As a veteran of forty some-odd shows from coast to coast, I have to agree with those who say that Bruce saves some of his best concerts for Philly. This was one for the ages - and for the hardcore fans. From extreme rarities (From Small Things\u2026, Pretty Flamingo) to rarely-played favorites (Incident, I'm Going Down, I'm a Rocker) to the rediscovered anthem Night, to the Professor's ultra-extended play solo and Bruce howling at the moon during Ramrod, to the haunting Streets of Philadelphia to the heartfelt renditions of the new \"Rising\" classics, this show easily makes my personal top five. Unlike the NY and north Jersey fans, the Philly fans don't demand a super blockbuster every night - and they're not pissed off like a lot of the NY'ers are when they don't get one. But when Bruce outdoes himself in Philly, like Monday, the fans really show their appreciation. If the crowd didn't seem as loud as one would expect (as a reviewer of one of the other Philly shows noted), I would blame the odd stadium design (completely open at the corners - not a \"bowl\" like Giants stadium), not the crowd. Also, Bruce had a funny quip about the Big Man and cheesesteaks, although I don't remember exactly what it was.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>TheBone</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">My first show, even though I am an old fart. I couldn't believe that tickets were still available, so we went. Got lucky with 37th row, dead center, just in front of the sound mixing booth. Thoroughly enjoyed it. What an unbelievable performer, extremely charismatic and engaging. Great voice; extremely soulful (love when he gets the crowd to do the back-up vocal, then just vamps over it \u2014 even the intro of the band members was a display of raw singing talent); advancing age doesn't seem to have touched his range. And (as a jazz fan), I've got to point out he's also a great bandleader; those were fantastic arrangements; with the sax, violin, organ, and piano, he's got a perfectly proportioned band with great musicians (I especially appreciated Roy Bittan \u2014 not too many rock bands have a pianist who contributes that much) who can really thump out the funk or slide easily into country, and, under Bruce's leadership, stop and go on a dime. And how many times did Bruce yell \"1\u20262\u20263\u20264!\" Didn't really care for the Linc, though being so close luckily, we had no sound problems. Getting into and out of the field seats was a nightmare (I guess that, like the missing water fountains, they forgot to plan for this). The 24 oz Miller Lites had to be the worst, fizziest, most watered down beer I've ever had. Video screens were good though. I've definitely got Bruce fever now; I see what it's all about. Gotta fill out the old CD collection.

One of the most exciting shows I have ever scene. From the opening song \"From Small Things (Big Things One Day Come) you knew it could be a special night. Where do you begin with this one? \"Night\", \"Darlington County\", \"Out in The Street\", \"Atlantic City\", \"Saint in The City\" and \"Incident on 57th St.\" to name a few. By request (A sign held up in front) Bruce thought out loud if he could remember that one before going into \"I'm Going Down\". So far on this tour \"Thunder Road\" has not been played so close together in set lists (previous night). It was done again tonight by request of local DJ and long time friend of Bruce Ed Sciaky whose daughter requested it. After saying \"Oh I Don't know, we just played it last night\", Bruce later in the show started the classic, walked over to Sciaky's daughter, wide armed, and said \"OK????\" judging from the crowd's reaction, it was fine. Three great shows in Philly ended with one to remember.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

This incident only seemed to loosen up Bruce and the band. Watching them play \"Out In The Street\", \"Backstreets\", \"Working on the Highway\", \"Born To Run\" and \"Rosalita\" confirmed what I've always thought \u2014 this is the greatest, most cohesive group of musicians I will ever see !!!

First of all, the show in Chicago was excellent. The seating and sound was amazing for a gigantic stadium (\"concrete mall\" is closer to reality) venue. While on the floor, you thought you were at a large theater, rather than a 50,000 seat arena. No small feat. So, if you're going to a show, hey, get seats in the pit, or anywhere on the floor, because you can hear and see all the action very well. Seats were available all over the place outside by the way. Buyer's market! Anyway (as Bruce would say), it was quite a show. The band and Bruce were as tight and as good as ever. Much more of a rock show than last year's tour. That was probably predictable given the Stadium thing. The highlights, I thought, were actually the Born in the USA songs (one of my least favorite albums); Working on the Highway, electric jug band style, was very hot and sounded fresh and better than ever. It also sounded different and broke the flavor of the show up a bit. Also excellent were versions of Bobby Jean, No Surrender and the final encore of \"Dancing in the Dark\". All 3 smoked. Personally, the highlight of the evening was without a doubt \"Backstreets,\" (the greatest rock song I've ever heard, ok, ok, I know you have others, but that's mine) Of course, I wish he would play the middle part of the song like he used to ages ago\u2026the song is just so much better with the bridge about the girl on the corner and the agony of lost love and betrayal, and also might end the silly debate on the Circuit about whether Terry is a man or a woman). The mix at the show was pretty good too, although I would have liked a few more Born To Run and Darkness songs, especially the less played ones such as Meeting/Jungleland, Candy's Room, Something in the Night (another of my favorites) but I guess, as always, you can't hear everything. The problem for me about the show though, was that it was too predictable (both in content and order) after last year's show. There was less of The Rising (which is fine with me although some of the songs were very poignant and in my opinion necessary to keep Bruce from being an oldies act), although I still think that \"Waitin on a Sunny Day\" doesn't cut it as a 21st century sing a long (the modern day Sprit in the Night\u2026 please) it's sold as. I would just ditch it. My main beef with the show is that I wanna hear some more remote ones, not the familiar crowd pleasers. Last few tours, all kinds of stuff was pulled out of the closet, NYC Serenade, For You, Sandy, Point Blank, Independence Day, and many others. I prefer a looser and more eclectic show, where anything is possible (The Fever? Frankie? who knows?) But hey, it's still Bruce, and any Bruce is still better than anyone else\u2026 by far.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>PackerBob</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">WOW! I have seen Bruce many times, he only get better and better. Waiting in the parking lot before the show, we heard the sound check and we were pumped\u2026 Everyone should see this guy at least twice\u2026 unbelievable energy and class. One thing that has always separated Bruce and the E-Street is that they have fun at their jobs while other bands act as if it is a job. Chicago should be embarrassed that he only had 1 show\u2026. Hard to believe in a city of 4 million people only one show, what did Boston have 5? Anyway, highlights were Working on the Highway and seven nights to rock\u20263\u00a01/2 hours of Bruce.

Every note he sang, every song, even the selections you could see coming from a mile away, was perfect. I loved the flashlight antics during the extended \"Sunny Day\" (\"We don't need no stinkin' lights!\") and was amazed when Bruce hung upside-down from his mike stand. Highlights \"Working On The Highway,\" \"Backstreets\", \"Born To Run,\" but I lost all control (and my voice singing) when those huge house lights came up for \"Rosalita\" and \"Dancing\"; everyone around me was singing and dancing in the aisle. The guy next to me and myself were jumping in sync.

However, I think he needs to choose a different song during which to introduce the band. \"Mary's Place\" really does not inspire anybody. \"Waiting on a Sunny Day\" really doesn't work for me either. I guess I'm just hooked on the old stuff. That song, along with \"Mary's Place\" doesn't have the relevance of the rest of \"The Rising\". However, when Roy hit the first few bars of \"Backstreets,\" I was right back on top of the world.

I recently caught 2 Philly shows and my streak of seeing at least one show per tour remains unbroken since the \"Born to Run\" tour 1975, Saw the Monday Night show with my brother and it had to be one of the Best shows I've ever seen in all my years of attending Bruce concerts, again this man absolutely the most incredible performer ever, he wears the audience. When the Full Moon appeared from behind a mostly cloudy night sky Bruce said he felt like he was turning into a werewolf and began howling at the moon with Steve soon joining in and then 50,000 Philadelphia fans all howling at the moon\u2026\u2026an incredibly funny moment. I was lucky enough to have the chance this time around to bring my 12 year old daughter to see the first night in Philly and she \"Rocked\" she even commented to me \"Dad Bruce is the Greatest and this is the Greatest Band in the World !\" But the downside here is that forevermore she will judge every band she sees by this standard of excellence and unfortunately they will all fall short\u2026\u2026\u2026 as for the music and the inspirations, the soulful feeling in every song all I could say is \u2026Bruce\u2026 Thanks for all the Love</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I've been to at least one show on every tour since the River tour. Other than a Smashing Pumpkins show in 95 this was the worst concert I've seen period. The sound was completely screwed up, bass was so heavy I could not make out vocals in most sets. My seats 14 rows from the front and center turned out to be 400 feet from the stage. Some genius put the stage in center field, left the infield empty, and had all seats at least 400 feet from the stage. Song selection blew. It would be nice to hear Thunder Road, Candy's Room, The River, Other side of the river. We got The Promised Land, Lonesome Day, My Love Will Not Let You Down, Empty Sky, You're Missing/Waitin' on a Sunny Day, Worlds Apart, Out in the Street, Across the Border &amp; No Surrender. Bruce used to deliver a solid show no matter what the quality of his most recent release. Unfortunately that is not the case with this tour.

Sitting in nearly the same area as Mr. Neal, the sound quality was FANTASTIC. Maybe he needs a hearing aid. If this show gets booted, it may end up being one of the gems from tour 2002-2003. The bass was audible, but it never overrode anyone else's instrument or vocal. You could even hear when Clarence played the finger cymbals! This was not at all like the typical sound of a stadium show. Again, a quality recording of this gig will be a real keeper. Saturday night was inspiring from the very start. Bruce and the band played extremely well \u2014 they led off with six songs in a row without a break, all played with a fiery intensity. I'd enjoyed Springsteen concerts for almost 23 years and, until last night, had never seen him do \"\"Something In The Night.\"\" What a treat it was to hear it, at last! Bruce introduced \"Across The Border\" \u2014 a tour PREMIERE \u2014 by saying they were going to do \"some California music.\" Although under-appreciated by people like Mr. Neal, it was nonetheless stunning. Bruce obviously worked hard on the arrangement and Suzy, in particular, was superb on violin. The main set closer \"Into The Fire\" was the finest version I'd ever seen them do, and the first encore opener, a full-band \"No Surrender,\" combined strength and grace in a whole new fashion. It was better than the April 9 performance they gave in nearby Sacramento. The joy and energy of \"Seven Nights To Rock,\" with the park's lighting full-on, brought everyone to their feet, even the idiots fiddling with their cell phones and beer cups who only have the Greatest Hits CD in their collection. \"Rosalita\" \u2014 after 15 years without seeing it \u2014 was magnificent, too. Every song was well performed, Bruce was typically magic, and the band was sterling. Any fool like Mr. Neal who claims last night was a \"\"rip-off\"\" should just stay home and watch \"American Idol\" reruns. An awesome, passionate, moving, and funny Bruce Springsteen performance, at $75 a seat, is the best bargain in rock and roll.

I do agree about the sound, some of what Bruce said I could not understand, the bass did seem a little over the top. On the other hand look at the venue. PacBell is a completely wide open venue, windy, echoes abound, it would have taken a magician to get it just right. Being in the pit was a first time experience, and it was GREAT. First off, way before the show in the early afternoon-meet great people (Christine from Oregon-petite, pretty with freckles) and others. So that was all fun to start out. Then, the show was simply outrageous. There is no such thing as a bad Springsteen show, and Bruce and Co. showed us why. Energy was amped up, Bruce hanging from the mic stand upside down monkey style, Ramrodding, Seven Days of Rock, Rosie(!!!), plus his \"Public Service Announcement\" were just a fraction of the highlights. I was curious, and maybe someone can answer this. How was the crowd? The pit, of course, was awesome. It is hard to tell if the rest of the place is also rocking. If they were not then we had too many SF wine and cheese forty niners fans\u2026 Springsteen and Co. love their fans, and it never shows more than through his concerts. SF was no exception.

There is no other way to describe it. His encore lasted about an hour. The crowd (sold out in 16 min) did not want him to leave the stage then. I am not sure how many people attended, but the entire seating of Pac Bell Park was sold out as well as seating on almost the entire field. I believe it is the first concert that I have attended where the event staff ended up dancing with people in the aisles.

As someone who has seen many Boss shows in many places, this was a more than solid effort in which Bruce, the band and the crowd showed tremendous energy and enthusiasm. The setlist was nicely varied, though obviously (and appropriately) focused on The Rising. The sound was very good for an outdoor venue.<br/>\nBut I do want to thank Griff for indicating that he'll stay home next time.

Sure, we missed 'Thunder Road' and didn't get any old 'Greetings' stuff, but we got 'Something in the Night', 'Seven Nights', and 'Rosie'! (I think think the problem for Mr. Neal was Mr. Neal.) We were on the field, stage left and about 18 rows back, and the sound was fantastic \u2014 crisp, clean, and powerful. The crowd was good. The park was brilliant \u2014 especially for the lights-on portions of the show when I turned around to look at the stadium from deep right-center field. What a sight! Bruce and the band were having more fun than I've seen them have since the last SF show in 1978 \u2014 a real, fun, and happy treat.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Killington</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">I too had a hard time with the sound quality at this show. At times Bass was overwhelming and always it seemed as though the sound man didn't really have soft in his musical vocabulary. It seems logical that it would be very hard to do sound for an outdoor arena so I'm not registering this as a complaint more as a sad fact. It was great to see Steve Van Zandt out of the Sopranos (though it's pretty fun to see him there too) and live on stage mugging for the crowd. Max Weinberg was also a treat. Unlike the Solo World tour where I really enjoyed the new Tom Joad material as much as the classics at PacBell I thought the old tunes were the best part of this show. It was hard not to be moved by The promised land-what a great way to open a show that would spend so much time contemplating the horror of 9/11 in that promised land. No surrender filled that same place for me in this show and I loved hearing it. For sheer fun Bobby Jean, Bad Lands and of course Rosalita were wonderful. If I had the choice to pay &amp;75.00 to see the show knowing what I now know would I? Of course\u2026 I'm thinking of flying to Colorado for one more hit of the boss\u2026 (It was also fun to see Patti blush when Bruce described her as a sexy thing\u2026)</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

On a league on their own are Suzie and Patti. Last but not least \"Mighty\" Max Weinberg, he was hitting that drum set like his life depend it on it. Among my favorites were \"Rosalita\", \"Across the border\" (\"California musica\" as Mr. Springsteen calls it, sounded very Italian to me, probably the best way to describe it would be California-Italian), \"No surrender\" and the first 6 songs it was what rock and roll is all about.

First of all, it seems as though a local crew was brought in to do these West coast gigs. The stage was a fraction of the size of the Giant stadium shows - as well as the video monitors. The direction and show selection of the video crew was horrible\u2026. the East coasts crew made it magical. Here it seemed to be done by local street hires. There were 30 second shots of Clarence hand hitting a tambourine. The sound itself was even worse. The bass drowned out everything. Bruce's mike went in and out. Altogether the mix was a disaster. The concert was randomly sold\u2026. meaning there were large patches of empty seats in better closer sections of the venue. Strange. I personally I go to concerts for escapism and Bruce does on occasion take us there but I find it really is a bit of a jerk-a-long when you're being taken to the highs of Badlands to the dark depths of Into the Fire and back again. It's hard enough to listen to those songs on the CD. It's a little redundant to then play You're Missing. Why not just hand out some prozac to go along with the mood killer. It was a beautiful Summer night\u2026and it was a party one minute and a wake the next. I once again I paid $80.00 per ticket (don't you think it would be a tad cheaper to sit a couple of football fields away from the stage?). I took my wife and two older kids\u2026that's $320.00 plus the $20.00 dollars for parking. Food? Another $40.00. You do the math. A few more concerts and I'll be going to a local food bank. When I went to Santana this summer, he announced that all of his concert tour proceeds were going to fight Aids. Bruce might consider a similar gesture.<br/>\nStill a big fan. But a little annoyed.\"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Steven Thompson</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">The Dodger Stadium security was the worse I had ever seen. Nobody knew what was going on. And they almost fucked up me and my sister's front row seats. But with a little luck we got in early and saw the soundcheck. The songs played were \"The Rising\",\"Lonesome Day\", and \"Empty Sky\", just a little of all of them.<br/>\nEverybody said how standard a show this was, well it wasn't standard for me. I had seen The Rising show in Vegas the year before. And yes,it was almost like it, but a Springsteen show at least I think is never the same way twice.<br/>\nSpringsteen and the Band came on stage about 8 to 8:30 the song they played while walking out, as we all noticed was The Beach Boys \"California Girls\", we noticed on the two big screens on each side of the stage Bruce and The Band were walking out, and I do believe Bruce and Patti's kids were walking with them too. And I thnk Patti was trying to get them to come onstage with them but it didn't happen. Ok, here's the setlist with a review.<br/>\nThe Promised Land (A year ago, maybe less than that, my sister and two cousins went to the Phoenix Rising show, and during this song, my sister who was in the front row with my cousins got the harmonica from Springsteen. So tonight, hoping for the same thing, didn't happen. I think it slammed into me hearing this song live again. I started singing every song that was played at that time, I didn't look at my watch till after the show had ended. First song of the night set the tone for the whole night, and the concert had started.<br/>\nThe Rising (A very good performance of the title track)<br/>\nLonesome Day (I love this song, and truthfully I am still trying to find a copy of the video version of this song. Anybody help me? Another very good performance.)<br/>\nMy Love Will Not Let You Down (I had not heard this song since The Reunion Tour, and I barely remembered all the words, it was very good though)<br/>\nProve It All Night (I love the album \"Darkness\" so any song of it is a pleasure for me. To me, almost as good as 1978 performance. Although I could be wrong. But that would be a first)<br/>\nDarkness on the Edge of Town (Title track was amazing. You should of heard the crowd when the lyrics comes \"Tonight I'll be on that hill\", the crowd was great, and in key as well. Great.)<br/>\nEmpty Sky (Kind of slowed the show down, but was amazing. I guess he still plays so we won't forget what happened that day.)<br/>\nYou're Missing (This is one of the saddest songs known to man. I have loved this song since I first heard it. I am morbid depressed kind of person. But I know how this song makes me feel in my little black heart. I would cry even a little, if I could.)<br/>\nWaitin' on a Sunny Day (Great song, and a great performance. I have loved this song as well. Even I have been doing this song live as well. I love the band and Bruce during this song, they look they are having so much fun. And so were we.)<br/>\nYou Can Look (But You Better Not Touch) (I have never heard this song live till that night, and damn, I remember all the words. Amazing! I love it.)<br/>\nDarlington County (I don't think I heard this song live either although I could be wrong. Wasn't there a line about The World Trade Center in it? I think I heard him sing it like that. And that was cool.)<br/>\nWorlds Apart (Another slow song that dragged down the show a little. But still a good performance.)<br/>\nBadlands (C'mon, it's BADLANDS! \"The light's out tonight, trouble in the heartland\")<br/>\nOut in the Street (I love this song from The River. Not much I can say but WOW! \"Meet out in the streets, BABY!\"<br/>\nMary's Place (Good party rock song. Intro to the band, funny and great. Another crowd sing along. \"Turn It Up!)<br/>\nAcross the Border (They played a full band version of this song the night before in S.F. So the show I went had the second performance, and it was different. But still great to hear a \"Tom Joad\" tune like that.<br/>\nInto the Fire (This didn't slow the night down. I think it made it better with the sing along part. I sang as well, and we felt as one. But maybe that is just me.)<br/>\nNo Surrender (Another song I have never heard live. And to me, it sounded different. But it was very good.)<br/>\nI'm a Rocker (A guy standing about 5 feet from had a sign that said \"I drove 26 miles to get here, Would you play \"I'm A Rocker\", and the son of a bitch got his song. Next show, I'm bringing a sign. But what song would I choose? I guess we'll find out when I got to Denver. Back to the song, I never heard this song live, and damn was it fun. I barely remembered the words to this song as well. Great!)<br/>\nRamrod (I lost count how many \"River\" songs he played that night, but I know it was more than any other album that night. I love this song. \"Let's Roadhouse\")<br/>\nBorn to Run (The crowd was AMAZING! This song was blown up fun. Not much more I can say it's \"Born To Run\". Need I say more.)<br/>\nSeven Nights to Rock (I have never heard this song before tonight. And now I'm going to sing this song live as well. My God! It was like \"Mountain Of Love\" in the 70's, at least to me. Just so fucking cool!)<br/>\nMy City of Ruins (Ok, another great song, but I prefer the version on America Tribute to Heroes. but we get to see Bruce play the piano. And that is always a treat. Love it.)<br/>\nLand of Hope and Dreams (Ok, now I'm getting scared at this point, cause usually this is the last song of the night. And I had drove 11 hours from Arizona to hear him play Rosalita, where was it? I love the ending of this song where he does a little of \"People Get Ready\" by Curtis Mayfield. That is my favorite part.)<br/>\nRosalita (Come Out Tonight) (FINALLY! I GET TO HEAR THIS SONG LIVE! And my god, did it rock. Bruce could of done this song and left the stage. Cause that would have been enough for me. This was the best part of the night. And my dream and wish came true. I got to hear \"Rosalita\" live.)<br/>\nDancing in the Dark (He got a second wind after \"Rosalita\", and did an outsatnding version of this song. We all sang along, till we were out of breath. A perfect way to end the show. Just out of breath and ready to collapse.) I guess that is it. I can't wait for Denver.<br/>\nP.S.

My buddy and I shelled out for a pair of front pit tickets off a scalper in the parking lot (saw Jeff Green outside stadium). Bruce and the band took the stage as the Beach Boys 'California Girls' played over the speakers. As goes for most LA shows, there were celebs in the crowd: Matthew McConaughey &amp; Cindy Crawford were there in the pit.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Every show different, always amazing energy, fun, poignant, relevant, the crowds are knowledgeable, singing, screaming, waving, laughing, crying (in NJ after 'Empty Sky'), DITD Bruce pulls a 10 year old up on stage, ID, DOTEOT, TTTB - afterwards parking lot is full of happy, exhausted fans - every show -amazing.

The highlight was definitely \"From Small Things\" which I had never seen in my 50+ shows. The sound continues to be a problem; especially during \"No Surrender\" where Bruce's vocals seem to become distorted during every Giants Stadium show. After seeing the 8/9 show in Philly and 6 of the 7 July shows in Jersey, I am really starting to believe that Philly may be the best place to see the Boss. However, a disappointing Bruce show is still better than anything else so let's just hope for two killers shows this weekend.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Bryan</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">This is my 6th show on the tour and my first time seeing Bruce in a stadium as well as New Jersey. I had somewhat low expectations of the set list since it was the first of the final three at Giants Stadium. Sadly, even with my low expectations, I was very displeased with the number of songs and length of show. At only 23 songs a 2 hour 40 minute set, both were very low for this point of the tour. I did enjoy getting three ultra-rare audibles though. I'm not a big observer of the band being \"on\" or \"off\" or if Bruce is in a good mood or bad mood so I'll let the comments already posted about that aspect stand as is. From what I've read, Bruce and band were above average. When he started with \"The Rising\", I figured he wasn't going to be playing around with the songs. Ties - Darkness - The Fuse is a less than desirable three-pack given the songs he typically plays in that section of the show. Fuse is a song that barely worked in the arenas, but should be put to rest for stadiums. The audience continually chattered during Empty Sky and it's obvious that Bruce is aware of that fact as he strums his guitar more instead of pick the notes in order to drown out the excessive noise. Bruce totally goofed up during \"Waiting on a Sunny Day\" by letting the crowd sing for too many verses and he skipped the middle section leading up to the 3rd verse. Be True was a nice treat (by request) but I wanted to hear something else prior to World Apart and thought that due to lack of up-beat songs to start the show, he would deliver. Indy Day was also a nice treat as I had never heard/seen it live. Once again, though, the audience did not give it the respect it deserved (you could hear a constant chatter in the background) but I guess that's just what the deal is when Bruce plays a 55\u00a0000 seat stadium. By the end of the main set, it was only 90 minutes into the show and at 15 songs, I started thinking the encores would be something special. I was wrong\u2026 From Small Things was a promising start, but Hungry Heart isn't what it used to be and although Ramrod &amp; Born to Run are played to perfection, to get nothing after Born to Run (even the CA shows that fans have said were pretty standard got a song after Born to Run) was a let down. Watching everyone rise to their feet at the pinnacle of City of Ruins was quite a sight and Rosie was a huge highlight. I was at the back of the floor seats by this time and it was just one big dance floor. DITD was an above average closer when he pulled a girl up from the Pit (nice going Ally). With Bruce is working his way up to the big finish this weekend, it won't be difficult to go up from Thursday night's set and length of show.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Rob Oslan</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Compared to the Aug 9th Philly show Bruce's energy level wasn't the same. I was hoping for something other than The Rising to open the show and the sound was bass heavy. Philly's sound on the floor was like hearing an excellent soundboard recording. The other disappointment was the lack of respect during Empty Sky and Independence Day. People were chatting and walking out like it was intermission time!!!! I can't recall this happening in Philly. Overall the show was better than most artists on their best night. So, with that in mind, it was still good to see the Boss!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Tom Cantillon</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Strong, solid show with some very good performances. The Fuse and Ties that Bind were very good, especially Ties, Bruce really delivered on that one. Independence Day was a nice treat, but a song that should have probably been played earlier in the set. Towards the end of the main set, Bruce needs to deliver a classic, such as: Backstreets, Incident, Jungleland or Racing. From Small Things rocked and was definitely unexpected. A strong show from start to finish, but seemed a little reserved at times.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Josh O.</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Wednesday - Spirit in the Night. Our tickets were purchased in April of 2003, so basically Cal \"Calhoun\" Heinle and I had to suffer through an entire summer of rollicking good times before we could have our raison d'?tre: two sold-out Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band concerts in the heart of New Jersey - Giants Stadium. If you ask us, Calhoun and I did a pretty good job of muddling through the summer, from partaking in champagne baths in May to having a 5K bar crawl in honor of Cal's 21st birthday to holding down both cities of Brackney, PA and Oswego, NY in rapid succession. So when the time had come, Cal and I gathered at 623 Jennings St (\"The House That Mama Built\") for pre-departure activities. We made those necessary preparations and not being physically or emotionally tired to call it a day, we sat and watched a tape of a Springsteen show from March. The fist-pumping that occurred in the living room of 623 did not compare to the rock 'n' roll hell-ride that The Boss was going to put us through in the coming nights, but this was the perfect, how do you say appetizer. My mom sat on the couch and listened as we made our setlist predictions, from Calhoun's sensible call for \"She's The One\" or my insane \"demand\" that The Boss play the entire \"Wild, Innocent and the E Street Shuffle\" album in its entirety. Plans were made to chronicle an hour-by-hour breakdown of the weekend, along with a tally of how many fist-pumps, handshakes, \"Holy Shit!\"s and/or platonic hugs would occur. At a perfectly reasonable hour, we parted for the evening, ready to get down to bidness. Calhoun mentioned later that he couldn't sleep a wink that evening, but instead sat up until 3:30am. Thursday - Baby, We Were Born to Run As Calhoun made morning preparations, I attended church. As I sat in the presence of the Almighty, I prayed in earnest for my previous request of the entire \"Wild and Innocent\" album setlist. Calhoun arrived back at my house at around 11am to finally make our departure. As all good road trips should, we began our voyage to the Holy Land by stopping at the Mecca of commerce - Wegman's. And we gunned that bitch to Jersey. For our aural enjoyment, we listened to Springsteen albums in order from Wegman's parking lot to 42 Burgess Place (The House That Baba Built). We rocked out from \"Greetings from Asbury Park, NJ\" to \"Darkness on the Edge of Town\" during the drive, only skipping over a few songs (including \"Wild Billy's Circus Story\"). Baba was very excited to see us, and she prepared some fantastic eats for us. After getting the dish (in more ways than one) from Baba, we departed Sesame Street in search of a supermarket and Route 3 East - the dusty beach road that would lead us to Giants Stadium. Upon reaching the parking lot in a whopping thirteen minutes (including a stop for gas), we established ourselves in section 4D. Incidentally, Calhoun had parked in the very same spot in the very same section for a Bon Jovi concert earlier in the summer. Though we mean no disrespect to Mr. Bon Jovi, we considered that concert a mere scrimmage. But this, baby, this is varsity. We set up base camp right around 3:35pm, as 89% of the lot was still empty. After toasting the events and grilling some fine cheeseburgers, we met our neighbors. They were very fun people, the Yankees fan and ever-benevolent Mike The Gambler and his sidekick, The Lady Who Hit on Us and Offered Weed. I said \"Up with hope and down with Dope\" to the latter, while Calhoun also passed on grass. We were content with the musical high that Mr. Bruce Springsteen would provide in, oh five hours. And we sat on. And sat. You know that feeling when the initial adrenaline rush of doing some rare hits us And you know that rush leaves you? Well, that hit around 6. And we still had an hour and a half before the gates even opened. So we journeyed our bones to the makeshift Jersey Shore carnival set up outside the stadium. There we listened to the tunes of Exit 105 (Might be a reference to the Turnpike, but I'm not sure), were spit upon by a Sierra Mist stand, and listened to the barbed insults coming from a real, live clown at the dunk booth. That killed about a half-hour, so we bounced back to the car for another healthy dose of sitting. As 7:15 approached, we left the car for Goldenrod (more on this later) and our entry to the house that Jimmy Hoffa Lies Under. Our seats weren't that bad, third row upper deck, leaving a great vantagepoint. We sat from 7:30 until 8:32, when The Man finally took the stage. The entire E Street Band received raucous cheers, but the place nearly blew up when Clarence Clemons (on sax) came out with a fedora, pinstripe suit and cigar. The setlist was basically a rundown of \"The Rising\", which I mistakenly labeled as \"doesn't translate live well\". Oh, but it did. The pairing of Worlds part&gt;Badlands&gt;Out in the Street was a particular high, and the appearance of \"Independence Day\" was wonderful. For an encore, Bruce brought out Bobby Bandiera for a rendition of \"From Small Things\". When Bruce announced that he was bringing out \"Bobby \" I almost had an attack because I thought the Rhythm Guitar Jesus Bobby Weir was coming out. We settled for Bobby Bandiera, and the results were nothing less than scintillating. The transition from \"Ramrod\" into \"Born to Run\" was fantastic, as the entire band left the stage while Roy Bittan (piano) played a five-minute solo. Bruce reemerged and sat on the piano while Roy rocked out, then the rest of the band came out for \"Born to Run\". Everyone in attendance obviously knows that it's going to be played, but when it hits, there's nothing like it. The second encore had the lone \"Wild and Innocent\" song from it - \"Rosalita (Come out Tonight)\", and we rocked from the coastline to the City. Bruce brought up a little girl to cut a rug with him during \"Dancing in the Dark\", the last tune of the show. We left our seats at 11:15pm and were back at Baba's by midnight. Not bad for two hicks from upstate New York. One show down, one trip to the Shore and one concert to go.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

The first show I've seen on the Rising tour (I'm getting old). Pretty Flamingo was a pleasant surprise; Bruce and the Band were as great as ever-they'll be rockin' until they are 100. Badlands was released in '78, BTR '75, Rosie 1973 and they are played with the fever and freshness of any new release. Much newer recordings have already been relegated to the oldie/nostalgia scrapheap; does anyone consider Rosalita, BTR, 10th ave Freez-out etc oldies? Clearly, Bruce and the E-Street band continue to demonstrate themselves to be the greatest rock band of all time bar none. Downside- Acoustics at Giants Stadium could never match an arena. Bruce was a speck from section 115; thank goodness for the large screen. Still, as long as they are performing- I'll keep showing up happy to see that old friends are doing quite well indeed.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Will Eremin</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Going into last night's show, I had know idea what would happen. I thought it might have been a standard set since they were filming, but I was wrong. Way wrong. When Bruce came out with the Butterscotch Telecaster, I new it was something special. They went right in to Janey Don't You Lose Heart. Followed by that was outstanding performances of The Rising and Lonesome Day. Lonesome Day went right into Candy's Room. That was the second time I heard it on the tour and it sounded better then in Duluth, GA on 2/28. I had never heard Trapped before but I immediately liked it. Bruce gave another beautiful performance of Empty Sky and Waiting On A Sunny Day was a blast. Right before the next song he said, \"Are you feeling lucky?\" At first I thought it would be Lucky Town but when the band started it was an ultimate rarity, Roll of the Dice. That's one of my favorite songs from Human Touch and it was great to hear. Before I could tell my Mother what song that was, Roy started the piano solo for Because The Night and I knew this would be an amazing night. Because The Night was great. I'm glad he did that instead of Worlds Apart leading into Badlands. It kept the momentum going. During Badlands the ground was shaking. Little Steven's solo was great. The momentum kept going when they blasted into Out In The Street. The oh oh oh oh's from the crowd were almost louder then the ban itself. At least from where I was sitting in Sect.332. When Mary's Place started Bruce was singing a song about Saturday night. Lots of people went to the bathroom during that song. I don't why. They missed the band intro's. After a 20 minute Mary's Place, Bruce introduced Emmylou Harris. She joined the band for a beautiful version of Across The Boarder. I never thought I would hear any song from The Ghost of Tom Joad album except Youngstown. It sounded great. That was definitely one of my favorites for the night. They next did Into The Fire which was also a great performance of the song. Although I didn't get to hear my favorite song, No Surrender, I got to hear my second favorite, Thunder Road. Bruce dedicated it to a man named Jim Berger who died on 9/11. It was amazing. My Mom cried because that was her favorite song. I love that song and I was so glad to hear it. For the first encore, Bruce dedicated This Hard Land to his friend Bobby Muller in the audience. I was so pleased to thear This Hard Land again. He did it in Georgia and I thought I'd never hear it live again. I was so glad that I did. Bruce then introduced a Philadelphia band named Marah and they did a great version if Raise Your Hand. After that they went right into Glory Days. I'd take that over Ramrod any day. After Glory Days, they went right into Born To Run. That song never gets old. It was great. After a long ending to BTR, 7 Nights To Rock was played. I immediately became a fan of that great song. Bruce went to the piano for the first part of My City of Ruins and then the 2nd part was the full band version. It was beautiful.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">John Wagner</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Amazing show last night! Maybe the best of the Jersey shows\u2026so far. Made me want to Raise My Hands. It was great to hear songs like Janey and Because the Night. Nice to see Bruce reaching a little deeper into the catalogue. I must say I really did miss Worlds Apart\u2026no, not really. I don't think anyone did. It looked like Bruce wanted to play something between Out in the Street and Mary's Place, but the Band didn't seem to notice. The only song that I heard during soundcheck that they didn't play was Lucky Town, so maybe that was it. Hopefully, he'll play it tonight. Pretty Flamingo was a nice treat, but it felt kind of like we were getting Philly's sloppy seconds. Thanks to the girl with the Crush on You sign\u2026I hope Bruce saw that and will play it tonight. I want to thank Bruce and the Band for a great show\u2026and a special thanks to that guy who felt Born to Run needed its own interpretive dance!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Kevin McDevitt</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">There are no words. Okay, maybe three: OHH MY GOD! This was unexpected, coming off Thursday's setlist, it was incredible, and unbelievable (ok\u2026six words :). Everything was great from the start. The band came out to \"Another Saturday Night\" (Sam Cooke); Bruce actually had to wait for Clarence, who was hamming it up for the backstage camera with a monster-sized stogie. I was a-hoping and a-praying that we would get something, anything besides \"The Rising\" as an opener\u2026and I could tell by the way he took a few extra seconds to start\u2026\"Janey Don't You Lose Heart\"\u2026that's a personal fav, he looked like he enjoyed playing it, and he just took us wherever he wanted to go from there. \"The Rising\": is it just me, or has the performance of that song come a lonnnnnng way since last summer? The real fun began after L'Day\u2026\"Candy's Room\" into \"Trapped\". What can I say? After Empty Sky (1st potty break :), a great \"Waiting on a Sunny Day\" (BTW: The weather was perfect; cloudy, but cool and breezy and NO rain). Then he really started pulling them out of the hat: \"Roll of the Dice!!!!\" I thought I was in Vegas! Bruce and Steve did a great \"just another roll\u2026\" back-and-forth at the end. Then an incredible 3-Pack: \"Because the Night (man, that song let's the whole band show off) into \"Badlands\" into \"Out in the Street\". It felt damn close to the RT 5-Pack. Other Notes: \"Mary's Place\" was fun, but the introductions were streamlined. Emmylou Harris was brought on stage to duet on \"Across the Border\" (I think that may have gotten a little lost in translation unless you were sitting/standing up close). \"Thunder Road\" was dedicated to the memory of Jim Berger; if memory serves, a big fan lost in the WTC. MIA: The Fuse (thank God), Worlds Apart, and the River/Darkness staples: Ties, Prove It\u2026etc. First Encore: \"This Hard Land\". It was awesome, and another personal fav. And the surprises kept coming with \"Raise Your Hand\" (members of the band Marah helped out, and had a great time). \"Glory Days' preceded \"Born to Run\", and the first encore finished with \"7 Nights\u2026\". Whew. Bruce plugged Al Franken's new book during his PSA before LOHAD. The final surprise on this night of surprises was a beautiful \"Pretty Flamingo\" sandwiched between LOHAD and Rosie. What can you say about this setlist. From where I was sitting, the crowd REALLY responded. There was a LOT of energy on stage (is he really almost 54? There's hope for us all!) , and the crowd gave as they got. After Thursday's show, so one was expecting this. Was there a better show on this tour? I haven't been to enough to judge, but, damn\u2026I almost don't want to go back tonight for fear of disappointment I said ALMOST :). If anyone has a problem with this show, you should maybe stop buying tickets and wait for Celine to come to AC\u2026.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>Rider in the Black Night</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">At this point, my favorite parts of any show are the wild card songs and last night had plenty of them. The camera crew completely botched the opener, choosing to film the Band in the tunnel, such that those of us not on the field couldn't even tell who was coming on stage and when. I would soon come to realize, they had assumedly been hitting the bong hard with the sound crew. As one of the few people who have deeply appreciated Janey for almost twenty years, it was a real pleasant surprise to hear him open the show with it, rather than something far more vanilla like Promised or Rising. Too bad the sound started off so bad that I thought it was The Ties that Bind ! Hey Sound Crew, ever heard of a SOUND CHECK?!!!! Unfortunately, they didn't get the sound right for at least 3 songs after that, for that matter. I couldn't hear Dan s keyboards until Badlands, finally. And even then things didn't sound right until halfway through the show. That infamous high-hat cymbal beginning to Candy s Room sends chills up your spine, especially when you re a true fan watching it live \u2014 and with the low clouds against an otherwise cool clear night sky Bruce turned it into a haunting introduction the eerie guitar riff to Trapped INCREDIBLE. A really funny moment came when Bruce played to the crowd with Sunny Day he started with Are there any LITTLE STEVEN FANS OUT THERE? to which the crowd (at least 75% Soprano fans? Am I the only true Miami Steve lover?) roared its approval. GOOD THING, because Bruce had WAY too much speed during his stage-slide almost broke his leg trying to keep from falling off the stage! (Which led me to conclude, if they had to go stitch Bruce up, I m ABSOLUTELY sure Steve &amp; Nils could carry the show for at least a few songs. Any true fans out there ever heard Bruce and Steve sing Native American on Steve s second album yes, Bruce CAN sing reggae!! but I m way on a tangent .) Then, after almost blowing out his knee, Bruce very appropriately yells WHO'S FEELING LUCKY?!?! to which I rolled my eyes [The early nineties stuff without the band (the Dark Years as I call them) does nothing for me at all] as they ripped into Roll of the Dice I knew another wild card had been spent, and unwisely. BUT THEN that all too familiarly haunting piano intro .. my decades long wait was finally over BECAUSE THE NIGHT LIVE I was on a cloud. I was thrilled at the rarities I was getting out of this show. Across the Border , with Emmylou Harris, another Dark Years song, got me nowhere AT FIRST BUT the whole Band gradually kicked in. I've gotta hand to you, Boss by the end this otherwise lame-o song had this Frankie -type depth to it that was especially satisfying to an E-Street-Band lover on a gorgeous summer night. For a fan like me, it was intense to hear This Hard Land with the crowd so still and quiet so I could really appreciate every note, especially Dan s accordion. And by now with the sound crew finally getting things right, the instrumentation was just awesome. I'll skip the vanilla stuff he did, but that first little riff off Raise Your Hand sent me springing out of my seat finally! After going to concerts since 1988, I got to hear this LIVE album classic!!! But who are those Bon-Jovi wannabe s from Philly? We didn't hear the answer, but my wife swore they were contest winners! Lucky bastards!!! (see show notes for the real answer). Then, when I thought all my wild cards had been dealt and played the first few notes of . What is that .?\u2026.. and then Bruce starts quietly crooning Pretty Flamingo . Wow that was great. Another concert classic I've just been too young to ever hear live myself! And then finally, after a 15-year wait for me, I got my fill of Rosie !!! nice! Too bad the crowd was a little complacent after hearing it at past recent shows they were more psyched of for Dancing to close but I've just never felt that song s better elements live in concert It s my humble opinion that some songs (BITUSA, Ties That Bind) are just better left in the studio. Incredible night for the aficionados \u2014 bring on the Shea Stadium shows!!!!!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Tom Cantillon</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Janey Don't Lose Heart was a great treat, followed by powerful performances of Candy's Room and Trapped. Candy's Room sizzled! A rollicking Roll of the Dice went into a blistering version of Because the Night. If only he'd done She's the One after Badlands, that trio would have been one of the best of the tour, no doubt. Emmylou Harris guested on one of my favorites from Ghost, Across the Border \u2014 beautiful version. The trio of Across the Border, Into the Fire and Thunder Road was beautifully done. Dreams, Love, Loss, the will to carry on, the belief in that \"magic in the night\" made those three work well together. This Hard Land was equally great, but Raise Your Hand was a blast. Great performance that took the show to a whole new level. Bruce needs to include that one more often\u2014hope it ends up on the dvd. Born to Run and 7 Nights were hard rocking. 7 Nights was Bruce meets James Brown, meets Jerry Lee Lewis, meets the Stray Cats \u2014 out of control \u2014 a rocking moment that was just a pleasure to witness and sing along to. Then, to add Pretty Flamingo, right before Rosie \u2014 a perfect moment, mixing heartfelt yearning and young lust. Simply amazing and better end up on the dvd, not the cutting room floor. One of the best shows, not only of this tour, but of any tour I've seen. You just had to be there \u2014 sorry if you weren't.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Josh O.</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Friday - Chasing Girls Down on the Boardwalk. Baba and I took Calhoun to the Lexington Diner for breakfast that morning, where we talked of the show and Baba called me \"Jake\". There's not even a Jake in our family. After digesting a creation called \"Disco Fries\" Calhoun and I headed to downtown Passaic to wait for our traveling companion, the long-lost Eleanor \"Not-Work\" Parker. Ms. Parker comes courtesy of the ever-memorable National Young Leaders Conference from way back in 1997. Following a summer of traded emails, she agreed to come along on our pilgrimage. And furthermore, she agreed to sit politely and deal with our shenanigans. After scouring for bargains in the Passaic shops such as the Bargain Man, we stumbled upon quite a bargain - a green and yellow O hat. In the midst of pulling that trigger on that must-have, the Calhoun's cellular telephone apparatus rang to alert the arrival of Eleanor. Following a tear-full reunion, we hopped in the car for the ride to the Asbury Park, long-time stomping grounds of Bruce and his band. In the ecstatic glow of getting the tickets in April, we decided to voyage down to the source of Bruce's muse - the Jersey Shore. Although many reported to us that Asbury Park had fallen into disrepair, we found it to be clean, attractive and almost completely empty. As we walked through the Convention Hall (which definitely could a coat of paint or three) we saw a sign for HAPPY HOUR. Well, that's all we really needed. We sat near a tiki bar on the covered porch, 12 feet from the water, listening to the music of a two-person acoustic guitar band. They obliged with our requests for \"Rhiannon\" by Fleetwood Mac and some Grateful Dead. We even did the handclaps for \"Not Fade Away\". And by \"we\" I mean \"I\". On a trip to find salt-water taffy, we stumbled upon the Cadillac Ranch, a new bar that had only been open for two weeks. Covered with lots of Bruce memorabilia and Jim Beam mirror that I desperately wanted, we found out a lot from a helpful barmaid. Turns out that five investors from Chicago have bought up the entire boardwalk and have plans to reestablish Asbury Park as a hot spot on the Shore. We applauded these investors' efforts and silently prayed for Bruce to walk through the doors at any moment. Alas, he did not. So we ventured for dinner. Following a supreme meal of pizza, Fettucini Alfredo (never met that Alfredo, but he makes a damn good pasta) and even better times, we journeyed back to the city of Clifton for a night's rest. The capper to the weekend was only hours away. Saturday - From the Coastline to the City All the Little Pretties Raise Their Hands College football's opening weekend coincided with The Boss festivities, so we watched College Gameday Saturday morning before spending a few hours in the pool, listening to some, you guessed it, Springsteen albums. We threw around more songs we wanted to hear. I abandoned my plan for the entire \"The Wild and Innocent\" album, but merely settled for a version of \"Raise Your Hand\". And then we spent hours \"diving\" into the pool for thrown rubber duckies. Calhoun and I attend universities not blessed with football powerhouses, so our allegiances to football teams are non-matriculation related. Eleanor, however, attended University of Alabama where \"Football is religion\". She regaled us with stories of people dressing up in fancy clothes for games, as if they were going to church. Sounds like fun. That's quite a switch from my school, where people stumble into a football game by making a wrong turn for Sutter's Mill bar. After being entertained by more stories from Baba over Chinese food, the first car containing Calhoun, Eleanor and I left for the stadium. Yep, still didn't take long. We couldn't park at 4D as we did before, so we settled for 13D or something. More toasts, more naked burgers (this time without cheese), more good times. When people would ask where we were from, we'd downplay our upstate heritage, but then mention with glee \"BUT SHE CAME ALL THE WAY FROM ALABAMA!\" There never ceased to get great responses from the crowd. While sitting having a deep philosophical conversation (not likely), our attention turned to the foliage across the road from the parking lot. Calhoun called it Goldenrod, so we took that at face value. While waiting in line to use the \"Port-A-John\", Eleanor and I noticed a steady stream of people running across the road to relieve themselves in the so-called Goldenrod. This act was gleefully christened Goldenrod, and became a highlight of the weekend. Let it be said that we were skeptical of the diagnosis of Goldenrod. What we saw was not Goldenrod. All that aside, calling it Goldenrod stuck. And continues to. Upon settling in the wrong seats in the wrong section, we took a sprint to the other side of the stadium to meet up with my mom, aunt and uncle for this show. And this show BLEW Thursday out of the friggin' water. The setlist featured some real gems, such as the hot opener of \"Janey, Don't You Lose Heart\". The first of many \"Oh Shit!\"s occurred as we heard the high hat opening to \"Candy's Room\" (then my aunt told me to calm down). While we were still digesting that, Bruce ventured into the rare \"Trapped\" and \"Roll of the Dice\". This was not a casual fan's concert. The second \"Oh Shit\" came as we heard Roy Bittan playing the opening lines to \"Because the Night\". They kicked it up one more notch, fulfilling our wish for \"Spirit in the Night\" followed by the typical \"Badlands\" into \"Out in the Street\". My mom just about melted when Bruce introduced Emmylou Harris for a version of \"Across the Border\". To close it out, Bruce rocked the house with \"Thunder Road\". For the first encore, he played \"This Hard Land\" (amazing) and then brought out the band Marah for my personal highlight of \"Raise Your Hand\". It's got to be a thrill for the dudes from Marah to be brought out at a sold-out Giants Stadium show and then share a mic with The Boss. Barely giving us a rest, they went right into \"Glory Days\" and all 60,000 people were all dancing, I swear. Right into the obvious \"Born to Run\" and then another favorite of \"Seven Nights to Rock\" The second encore was more typical, with only a rendition of \"Pretty Flamingoes\" to spice it up. This was the first time the band had played it since 1978. The normal \"Rosalita\" followed by \"Dancing in the Dark\" to close out what was a supreme A+ show. Both Calhoun and Eleanor were departing after the show, so farewells were shared and then they were both gone like a spirit in the night. We christened this one of the best weekend of all time. Nothing much more can be said about it. Thank you for reading.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

The weather was perfect, the crowd was energized, and the Band and Bruce were oh-so-tight. Now my tenth time seeing the Boss since 99, this was the best. The crowd was as energized and into the concert as any I've seen, and Bruce was really having a great time; the best concerts I've been too, the energy on-stage, up front, and even in the seats way in back was palpable. That was certainly true of this concert. The tried and true only would have appreciated the opening of Cynthia. Very surprising selection, but it did the trick. It must be said though, that they probably could have played Happy Birthday on stage and that would have done the trick on this night. Rising and Lonesome Day, the 1-2 set standards this summer, were as polished (and finely broadcast, thanks to a getting-their-act-together-finally sound crew) as any versions I've heard. And then NIGHT. While I've heard this before in concert, as it is not quite a rarity, the band at this point made their statement that they were here to put on a show for the ages. Truly amazing. I think the highlight of the night came after the Sunny Day sing along (Bruce seems to have timed that stage slide just right at this point) when he started asking Can you feel the SPIRIT? I was going nuts. I've only heard Spirit once before, earlier this summer, but this was just so much fun. And then, spirits definitely up (pun intended), came a most memorable 1-2 punch, maybe one of the best parts of the night. Because the Night, that LIVE set standard, was amazing to hear in concert. What a song. When it didn't seem like there could be anything more coming off the stage, or from the crowd, the opening rhythm of BADLANDS hits the crowd like a wall, and the place went crazy. This opened it up for even the most casual fans in the audience, and got everyone rocking. As I am beginning to offer a rather lengthy account here, I will cut to a few more of the rarities and true highlights: Lost in the Flood was really stark and haunting such a vision of those lost souls we so often hear about from Bruce. Into the Fire, which is, of course, so immediate and relevant, and one of the finest songs on The Rising. Closing the main set with Promised Land, that beautiful harmonica throughout a great way to bring it back up, and, at this point, played with such conviction and true musicianship from the band. The first encore set was the most amazing three song combination I've heard in some time, in no small part coming from the fact that I turned to my friend as they walked onto stage and said, I feel Kitty s Back. While I felt it, when that guitar opening hit, I was thrown a bit as was, I think, much of the crowd. This song is so much fun live, and the band was at its best in the break in the middle, doing some really tight jamming. Roy, Danny, and then Bruce just played their hearts out on this break, and it showed. And then, when Bruce was looking down at the end of the alley, coaching the crowd with Here she comes , it took off. High energy led into a tight, solid Glory Days, which brought the energy (now for the WHOLE crowd, not just aficionados) through the well where the roof would approximately be at Giants Stadium. And then, as always, Born to Run, Stadium lights on there s really nothing like it, even if it is a show standard. Not a surprise, but certainly a jewel of the show. With the second encore being standard at this point, it probably only needs to be noted that each of these songs simply received a terrific treatment tonight. Rosie coming out was also a highlight people pumping there are to punctuate Clarence s sax solo in the middle and, of course, some of the best lines of the night: I ain't here for business, I m only here for fun. I think the band really was only there for fun last night. The last surprise, which, to some extent was a wished-upon, I-bet-he ll-do-it kind of surprise, but a truly happy one nonetheless: closing off the summer and the historic Jersey stand with none other than Jersey Girl. There were tears from some people on this: and it was a beautiful way to close the shows at the Stadium. Truly a great night to be alive and a Bruce fan.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Dan</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">This South \"Jersey Boy\" stepped out into the night last night hoping Giants Stadium would prove to be lucky town and he would finally get to hear Jersey Girl. Bruce and the E Street Band truly are the best \"little house band\" and came through on a magical night. The weather was great and the fans were full of excitement and electricity before the band even took the stage. It was great hearing some of the old classics like Kitty's Back, Lost in the Flood, and Spirit in the Night. My wife was thrilled to hear Because the Night and Badlands. Having been a Bruce fan for thirty years now, I can honestly say that Bruce and the band seem to be cheating time by getting better, not just older. The guitar solo's, keyboards', and the Big Man's solo's are as long, loud and great as ever - you just can't feel the music recorded like you can in their live concerts. Ending the concert with Jersey Girl made my night and made the long drive home through the swamps of Jersey go a lot quicker - no chance of falling asleep after a Bruce concert. I feel extremely lucky to have been at two of what I believe and hear were two of the best concerts. Last night's in Giants Stadium and the August 11th at Lincoln Financial in Philly, where I was really lucky and got tickets in the pit, ending up right in front of Bruce, about four people back from the stage. There's no doubting Bruce when he sings \"I'm a Rocker\".

But it is a crowd favorite, maintains the intensity level, and I must secretly admit that I sing along with everyone else\u2026do I dare admit that maybe, just maybe, this song really works? But let this serve as notice\u2026.the next time I throw a house party and 55,000 of MY closest friends show up, I'm gonna play Thundercrack!!!<br/>\n24) and last, but not least\u2026.the BIG ONE\u2026\u2026 should be a rocker, right? The last song at every Rock and Roll show is supposed induce cardiac arrest on every single audience member, right? Its the first law of Rock and Roll\u2026.violate this law and you are banished forever to Manilow-land. The last song is supposed to force you to confess, make the dogs on Main Street howl, and rip the bones from your back. So naturally, Bruce stays between the lines because he's a good, law abiding Rock and Roll citizen\u2026\u2026..INCORRECTAMUNDO, Potsie Weber. He does Jersey Girl. In New Jersey. On the last of 10 shows at Jersey Giants Stadium. For all the Jersey Girls. Even the ones from New York. He didn't even write the damn song. And its a slow, \"last chance dance\" number to boot. Time to overhaul the Rules of Rock and Roll.<br/>\nAnd so, ladies and gentleman, that's how my summer ended.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Tom Cantillon</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">What can anyone say about a show that has Night, Spirit in the Night, Because the Night, Lucky Town, Lost in the Flood, Kitty's Back, Rosalita and Jersey Girl all wrapped up in one amazing performance? AMAZING! OFF THE CHARTS! WOW! Bruce and E street Band cap off a mind-blowing, earth-shaking, brain-shocking, hard-rocking 10 nights with a truly legendary show. Spirit is always a great live song. Because the Night was scorching! Bruce's passionate guitar work makes that song sizzle and sweat! Lucky Town was also very good. But Lost in the Flood \u2014 a song, done live, that resonates through one's soul very much the way Jungleland does. Powerful lyrics/images that imbed themselves in your mind like a movie that would star a young Marlon Brando or Paul Newman, when they were real rebel-rousers. Truly a masterpiece. \"his body hit the street with such a beautiful thud.\" intense. When Bruce is done touring, he should consider directing. Kitty's Back \u2014 just a great, fun, rollicking, rock 'n' roll moment that is as light as Lost is dark and disturbing. Great combo, and who would have thought that you would hear both on the same night in Giant's Stadium. Rosalita \u2014 simply a blast! And Bruce finds a fitting way to pay tribute to his home-state by belting out a heartfelt version of Jersey Girl. It was the right song. The ten nights, (can't believe they are really over) were without a doubt nothing short of amazing to have witnessed. True, a lot of people complained about songs not heard, brief shows and what not, but I never left disappointed. I was simply grateful to have been there and been fortunate enough to see a true showman and performer pump out some of the most earth-shaking rock 'n' roll shows ever! I had had my doubts about stadium shows and Bruce's age, as well as the bands. But they rocked harder, with more sincere passion and commitment to each and every show, than most other bands ever do. Thanks Bruce and E Street Band for 10 memorable nights. Hope you'll be back in another 2 years\u2026I need to save some money.\"</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I can't recall a show that Bruce opened with a cover song other than Who Will Stop The Rain. An Beautiful version of You're Missing and the powerhouse Because the Night and the surprise of No Surrender after Badlands (which included 2 false endings).

I arrived at about sundown and walked into the outfield area and I almost felt like I was walking into heaven. I don't believe there is a heaven, but that's another matter for another e-mail. With the stadium lights shining on me as they never had before - since I have never been on the field at night- there was definitely something surreal about it. I cannot exactly say I got chills, but it was truly a special moment that I will never forget. As far as the show went, it was fairly spectacular. After darkness settled and the moon rose higher, the thrills came early and often. Something that I've always found special is the way Bruce personalizes his appearances in whatever venue he plays. During the Saturday night show, he managed to work in a reference to the \"Combat Zone\". He even rhymed it with something. I'm sorry to say, I cannot remember during which song it was. If you aren't familiar with Boston, the combat zone is the \"Red light\" District in town. He also, very possibly without even being aware of it, personalized this show even more by playing a rousing version of \"Ramrod\". Once again, for those of you not familiar with Boston, the Ramrod is a very popular leather bar right across the street from Fenway park. On Sunday, the chills did come out when I heard the opening violin on \"Jungleland\". As that faded and Roy took over, he held the first piano note as a tease, and I may never again feel that happy. Or so I thought, until I heard the opening of \"Thunder Road\". Not even the drunken nitwits in front of me could spoil the moments. My friend and I estimated that they consumed about 200.00 worth of bad beer, and they acted like it. Even so, these were two nights I will always cherish and never forget. Plus, Bill Walton walked by us about 6 different times. What more could a Boston fan ask for?</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

By the end of the third song, Bruce was hanging upside down from the microphone stand, staring at the crowd and egging us on. Bruce played to all the emotions with the set list- you can tell from the titles that he pulled out all the stops for us- and the band was there at every break, every call, and every ad-lib. Is there a better band than the E-Street Band? I think not. During 'Frankie' they showed why. After a couple of shots at getting it started, Bruce laughed, told us they hadn't played it in a while, so it figures they'd be rusty. He walked over to the Professor, counted out the beat, stalked over to the mic- and the band ripped through it like they had been playing it straight since 1976. It was a magical night, from the baying at the moon (broadcast on the screens, superimposed over Bruce and Stevie leading us in the howls) to the exorcism of the Babe's curse. Peter Wolf did an encore with the band on Dirty Water- gave Bruce his coat a'la James Brown! Too cool! Thanks, Bruce and E Streeters, for bringing magic in the night to my hometown.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Mark Bailen</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Amazing! Magic in the Night! A perfect late summer evening and an almost full moon were the setting for the greatest rock'n'roll show in the world in the most charming baseball park in the U.S. Bruce has a special relationship with Boston dating from his early successful club appearances there and continuing through John Landau's declaration that he was \"the future of rock'n'roll\" after seeing a performance in Harvard Square. Sunday Bruce was in top form and he seemed genuinely excited to be in Boston and in such a unique venue. I've seen him about a dozen times over the years and was a bit disappointed by the show at the Providence Civic Center last December. It seemed to me that the impending Iraq war and perhaps middle-of -the -tou doldrums made for a rather joyless event. I would have to rank the Fenway Park show as the second best of all the shows I've seen him do (the Boston Music Hall, spring 1976 is still the most amazing performance of any kind I've witnessed in my life). It was a privilege to wander the historic ballpark and share the experience with my 15 year old daughter who finally was able to see firsthand what I've been carrying on about all these years. It would be a little ridiculous to point out specific high points as the energy and excitement just kept on building especially after the relative lull of the rare but calm \"\"Frankie\". The mix of old and new songs was amazing . It was one hell of a party. An added positive note is that true to his usual \"good guy\" image Bruce made plenty of tickets available online and at the park immediately prior to the show so that the loyal fans could have a fair chance to score an un-scalped ticket. Long Live The Future of Rock 'n' Roll!!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Glenn Graubart</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">This is the third show on the Rising tour. Each of the shows that I have attended have been very special. September 7th was my 11th show and by far the very best that I have ever seen. Special Notes from the evening \u2014 Adam Raised A Cain: I absolutely think this song shows Bruce's vastly underrated guitar skills as a master of the instrument. Having seen the 8/2 show, I was afraid that I was going to get a lot of the songs I saw on that night as well as 10/4. How wrong I was! Something in the Night: Absolutely spellbinding. Most of the crowd did not know the song. Spirit In the Night: This was the song showed Bruce that the crowd was really into it. Great version - absolutely jammed. For You: This was an audible from what we could tell. What a great One - Two punch from Greetings for this very special show. Because the Night - Although I like World's Apart - he could not have picked a better song to replace. Another song that really shows Bruce as Great guitar player. Badlands - Just a fabulous version. Great song. Nice Coda at the end. Frankie: What a special treat for the real fans that showed up at Fenway. Jungleland: Wish this was a standard. Maybe that is why I love this song because he plays it so rarely. I have seen it three times (9/19/88, 7/18/99 and 9/7). All of the songs that I have seen him play this sot have been the show stopper. Thunder Road: Great way to end the set. Again because he is not playing it every night makes it special. Glory Days: The howling at the moon was truly great. Fitting song for Fenway - just miss the great stories he used to give before this song in 84-85. Dirty Water: He did it much better than the 10/4 show.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Dave D.</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">This was my fourth and favorite show on this tour and twenty-fourth overall. It even beat out Atlantic City for me. A perfect night for music. The temperature was just right in the mid 60's.The almost full Moon and Mars were staring at Bruce and the Band in a cloudless sky. The world's greatest house band was just that. The crowd (including former Celtic Bill Walton 20 feet to my right) was having as much fun as the band. Given the current athletic movement and stamina of Bruce, I'd pick him in a game of one on one basketball over Bill Walton at this point. I'm not trying to disrespect Bill, but most people are just awed at Bruce's ability to maintain himself night after night. How many athletes about to turn 54 able to do what Bruce does on his tours? My companion got her wish for Thunder Road as I got mine for Jungleland. It was her first Springsteen show and it was just awesome for me to see someone so mesmerized by everything. Other big highlights for me were Adam Raised a Cain, Spirit in the Night, Because the Night, She's the One, Further On Up the Road, and Rosalita. Bruce's commitment to excellence, spirituality, responsibility, and accountability of those in government are all important pieces to the show, which I hope we can all learn from. They played for three hours and even though we had some fatigue, we wished the show would never end. Another classic night that I'll never forget.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">John Malone</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">This was THE ONE.

Something in the Night and Spirit in the Night were excellent choices. In between, was a powerful Empty Sky. This song evoked sad memories of 9-11. The song was especially powerful since Fenway Park lies in the shadows of Boston's two skyline buildings; the Prudential and Hancock towers. Frankie was also a wonderful surprise. It also seemed to surprise Danny since he seemed to begin playing Independence Day before Bruce ran over to him and playfully clarified the next tune on the list. Jungleland was awesome and I loved hearing Further On for the first time live.

In terms of song selection, mixed messages all night: the 9-11 grief [7 of the rising songs] - vs - the busting out for freedom of youth/ \"young lovers\", imagery [jungleland, because the night, bobby jean, rosalita, born to run, she's the one, no surrender, darlington county, badlands]I think the 2nd theme won over. So, a very jekyl and hyde night - hence maybe the howling at the moon: he had the crowd howl at the full moon sitting just above the Dome 5 imes - by the way, the paper says it was the first open air Dome concert ever. He played a great rockabilly song called Seven Nights I never heard before, apparently written by \"Moon Mullican\" - great lyrics: \"I've got seven nights to Rock, seven days to Roll\u2026\" [repeated over and over..]. Then there were the Three Stooges antics during Ramrod - he fell on his back like a seizure; then did the famous shuffle, then went cross-eyed like Curly and started arffing and barking into the microphone !!! Comparing to what I saw 2 weeks ago at Giants stadium, he was WAY more playful and full of energy last night. Reinvigorating for sure - unlike last December's show at the ACC the crowd was into it all night -maybe it was the full moon, maybe the Dome being open, maybe the last gasp of summer mentality\u2026 who knows\u2026but for a guy at the end of a 120 date Tour, Bruce looked like he had a lot of pent-up energy to let loose.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Vanessa West</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">This was the very first concert I have ever attended.

Also 2 (that's right) reprises of Badlands. Born to Run was extended longer. My City of Ruins added a vocal coda. Bruce walked out with an acoustic guitar and went right into I Walk the Line. I was expecting Give My Love to Rose, but this was even better. It started with just acoustic and the band joined in. It was sparse and mid tempo. The Fuse made a welcomed return. The performance was fresh and intense. One of the Bruce virgins said afterwards that it was his favorite song. Also You're Missing is so touching. It always hit me more than Empty Sky. Everything is everything but you're missing. During the band intros Bruce said, \"And it's time to impeach the president and put a big man in the Whitehouse.\" My jaw dropped - then the people yelled impeach impeach - Bruce even joined in for a moment. Human Touch was a great surprise. Blistering guitar work. The cheesy keyboard from the 92 tour is gone too. One of his best. Soozie's violin on Jungleland fulfilled a dream I've had since I heard the song. She played throughout the song. Paradise worked better than expected in a stadium. At the start of the encores, Bruce said \"We haven't played this song in 20 years (words you love to hear).\" He then switched guitars before Nils said, \"I remember it.\" Pink Cadillac started up and was quite ragged. Then again it's about sex so that was the right way to play it. It seemed like the band was making it up. I haven't heard Ramrod since they added the Bosstime (what time is it??) bit. I was anxious to hear it and it didn't disappoint. Bruce said \"Steve, it's time for me to go. I have to return to my undisclosed location.\" 7 Nights to Rock should be played at every show. Maybe even last. What a fun great song. Dick Chaney must have been at the show cause Bruce mentioned him negatively 3 times. \"I like people of all parties coming to my show - except Dick Cheney.\" I really wanted BITUSA but hoped for Land of Hope and Dreams too. Only got one but, BITUSA is so powerful full band. It makes for an angrier show. He doesn't disappoint.

But after that, although each performance was given it's all, it appeared that it was going to be a fairly standard show. You're Missing is far more emotionally devastating than Empty Sky and should simply replace it. The Fuse was great, but just added to the somber mood already set from the first song. But once Bruce and band kicked into Human Touch, the entire show was catapulted to another level. A powerhouse version of Human Touch simply blew the place away and when Bruce launched into She's the One, the place just went wild! She's the One has always been one of the those songs the band best performs live and that night \u2014 it rocked with a blistering, sexual intensity and ferocious passion. Bruce needs to keep performing this one for the rest of the tour \u2014 a much-welcomed replacement to the overplayed Out In Streets. Paradise actually worked and sounded very haunting live. Well done. Jungleland is simply Bruce and band at their best. No matter how many times you listen to the lyrics, they still have a way of hitting you like a locomotive. And those final moans of anguish from Bruce can't help but produce chills every time. Into the Fire continues to be one of my favorites. Encore time brings a rollicking Pink Cadillac that made you wonder why Bruce doesn't play this one more often. Ramrod, Born to Run and 7 Nights are simply a trio of hard-rocking killers \u2014 better end up on the DVD. Having now added Born in the USA as a replacement for LHD has been one of the best decisions Bruce has made in regards to adding/removing a song. It simply makes the last set of encore songs as strong as, if not stronger than the first set \u2014 nice choice! Great show overall and seems almost like a new show compared to earlier this summer. Check them out if you haven't already and definitely go back if you already have seen them, because they simply keep getting better.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">John Locke</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">This is the second time I've had the privilege of seeing Bruce in concert, and I'm much more appreciative of the man, the myth and the music.

David is a recent Naval Academy Grad, who is living in DC right now before he goes to FLA and flight school. T-man and I saw Bruce 4-26-00 in Pittsburgh. Where Bruce Tore the roof off with Spirit in the Night, Adam Raised a Cain, Back in your Arms Again, and of course Jungleland\u2026 Jungleland is a personal favorite of both me and the T-man, but David has just discovered the Born to Run album, and a love for the final track. This concert was so special for me, not only because of the Johnny Cash Tribute, or Bruce playing my anthem \"The Promised Land\" or how patriotic the 9/11 feel of the concert was, but because Bruce Played Jungleland (Especially with Soozie on Violin\u2026). It was like we were back on Marion Hill, in a dark driveway at 3am, with the radio blaring and all Jaming out to no end\u2026. \"Outside the streets are on fire\u2026\" To My Boys, The Boss, and the Band\u2026 all I can do is say \"Thank You\" (also, is it just me or does Patti looked smokin' hot during this tour.

Candy's Room appeared to be by request - and the extremely rare \"Brilliant Disguise\" was definitely by request.

The pre-encore setlist was pensive, introspective, almost downbeat in theme and tempo, with \"41 Shots,\" \"Darkness,\" \"Jungleland\" and return of \"You're Missing\" to the set. It was acoustic-heavy; not much upbeat. But then - the feel changed 180 degrees with the encores, including the explosively rocking first five. The metamorphosis was simply tunning. Early part of the concert was hot, with bugs flitting about Bruce nonstop. At one point, he held up a locust and said \"Now, what the hell is this?!\" as the cameras zoomed in. Later, at piano for \"My City of Ruin,\" he asked \"And what was the bug, the school mascot?\" It was funny, but the definite comedic and concert highlight was the apparent return of \"Jon Landau Girl.\" As Dancing in the Dark started, she held a sign overhead with an arrow pointing down at her that said \"I'm Jon Landau.\" Stevie pointed her out to Bruce, whereupon Bruce pulled her up on stage, Steve gave her his guitar and she ran around and rocked in place with all the band members that had Bruce and everyone grinning ear to ear. It was truly a scream; the funniest thing I've ever seen at a concert and a remarkable ending to a simply most remarkable show.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Zach Dickerson</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">All I can say about this show is that Bruce must have known I was in the audience.

Ghost of Tom Joad was great to hear and Leap of Faith finally found it's way into the set. Human Touch is powerfully played and leads into a killer version of She's the One. Spirit in the Night is always great to hear. 41 Shots was an odd choice, not sure it works in the overall theme and collection of songs, but still a powerful song. Backstreets!!! Why Bruce doesn't play this more often is a puzzle to me. One of his all-time best songs. The images from his lyrics are so hauntingly powerful that it's almost like listening to a musician paint with words. Great song! Needs to find it's way into the setlist a few more times before the tour ends. Those last four songs: My City of Ruins, Born in USA, Rosalita and Dancing are simply an amazing moment selected to close an already amazing concert.

Bruce hit the stage about 8:25pm with just an acoustic guitar and opened with The Ghost of Tom Joad, pretty much a total surprise for the crowd, then the band came out and did a fantastic version of No Surrender, again a bit of a surprise to me to have it show up so early in the set. Some of the highlights were Leap of Faith, Backstreets, Spirits in the Night, Ramrod, and Human Touch. The biggest highlight for me was She's The One. What a great version. Lets Be Friends was another surprise, enjoyable, but a bit ragged. Bruce seemed to be really into the show and looked to be having a ball on stage.

In the real sense of the word. A show that overwhelmed me. It is hard to believe this, but it was the most moving show I have seen. In a half empty concrete bowl during a hurricane watch. You just can t predict when the lightning will strike and Thursday night was electric. Just check out the additions to the setlist: Souls, Night (does it get any better?), Leap , an acoustic Factory with Patti - like the reunion tour, Living Proof (a song to stir the soul of any parent), Because the Night, solo piano Incident (with the lyric pages flapping off the piano in the breeze Tape boys! I need some tape up here! ), Janey (beautiful) and Goin Down. The start, Souls, reaffirms his growing outrage at the loss of life in the Mideast in a power packed song. Reminded me of when he opened the June MSG sows with Code of Silence as a direct response to the misguided outrage over American Skin. As he said every night on that Reunion Tour, I ain't Bullshitting up here and he made his point. That thread echoed again in his soap box address which gets more pointed by the week before LOHAD which is BACK! Thank the lord. There was a great, rowdy bunch of early 20s-ish fans with the BITUSA bandana look in front of Clarence in GA that pogoed the hell out of that song. Bruce loved it, kept pointing them out to Stevie and he bounced a lot himself. Before City he did the usual short Food Banks speech and some poor loser right next to me in GA screamed during the complete silence Shut Up and play the song! Just sad. Looking around for approval and the crowd just shakes its head wondering what he could be thinking of. Clarence fell and could not get back up during the encores. We thought he was having a stroke. He finally got up and finished out the show fine but he was down for a good 30 seconds. Scary. When the band leaves the new UConn stadium (pretty lame, aluminum benches instead of seats) they have to climb out over the top of the bleachers behind the stage it was hysterical. The path was all switch backs so first one side of the crowd could see them and roar then the other side. It took forever. Reminded me of the Spinal Tap scene where they are lost backstage and just keep wandering around saying Good evening, Cleveland! Well I though it was funny. On to Shea for me. He got looser yet more focused with each song. He raged, he laughed, he preached, his intensity burned through you. Faith. Hope. Peace. Justice. Redemption He ain't kidding boys and girls. He is here to save your soul.

Soundchecked Souls several times so I knew it was coming, though I didn't expect it as the opener. Being up front in the pit I could see Bruce and Co were loving it. Next, with huge smiles, they blasted into Night. Then, what may have been the usual got going, but with a higher than usual intensity and they delivered a tremendous Rising/Lonesome/Leap of Faith. Having seen this tour 15 times this was the best opening 5 song shot I had seen. A few slow numbers and then the heart of the setlist ..Promised Land, Living Proof (with all the emotion that song brings to the surface), Because the Night (seemed a little less rocking than I would have hoped), Badlands, Out in the Street, Mary's, Incident ( Bruce cleared the stage for this one as a Piano solo. At the very end Roy came out to play the last few notes and gave The Boss a big pat on the back with a seamless transition into..) Thunder Road. There was such energy on the stage for this, words can not describe it. This was the Band in their element. I felt they were enjoying this performance so much they would have paid us to be here\u2026that's how much fun they were having. Bruce was pointing to the faithful in the pit constantly, running all over the place making eye contact with as many of us as he could. Janey and an excellent I'm Going Down (\"here's one we don't play much\") opened the 9 song encore and we got a rather standard final hour\u2026though the pit all begged for more as we chanted \"one more song\" after Dancing.

Bruce and the band were sizzling and went way beyond my expectations \u2014 and I had fairly high ones for it being show #99 for me. Souls of the Departed was outstanding \u2014 beautifully done. It was great to hear Leap of Faith \u2014 works so well with the Rising tunes. Factory was a big surprise and nice to hear. Bruce was done-right scorching on Living Proof! About time he pulled that one out \u2014 what a great song with beautiful lyrics and intense guitar playing \u2014 a tour highlight! Because the Night and Badlands of course were out of control. Mary's Place is just amazing to hear live \u2014 very powerful and spiritual. At this point, I was already believing this was the best show I've seen, and then Bruce pulls out Incident! A beautiful piano version and not played often enough during the tour \u2014 in my opinion \u2014 should have been on the setlist every other night. Magnificent song and a heartfelt version. The encores were a blast: Janey and I'm Goin' Down were simply great, as were Born to Run and a powerhouse version of 7 Nights. Show #99 \u2014 my favorite of the tour. Thanks Bruce for a memorable performance and a great way to leave my double-digits as I move on to show #100. Record this show and put it out there for your fans to enjoy! The best tour you guys have done! Rock 'n roll at its ultimate coolest and best!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Obviously inspired by the rural amusement park setting, Bruce opened with Tunnel of Love and followed with Brilliant Disguise. I forgot his exact words, but he told the crowd that he and the band liked the feel of the place. The cozy circus-tent setting also no doubt prompted him to debut County Fair, with Danny on accordion. He told Danny to move to the front of the stage with him so people could see when he \"F\u2026. up.\" It was an appreciative crowd that had a good time.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

It's obvious Bruce doesn't let anything or anyone dictate what songs he does. Opening with \"Souls of the Departed\" (an obvious tribute to Warren Zevon &amp; Johnny Cash), and closing with \"My Beautiful Reward\" is certainly different than what anyone could have predicted, (especially with the pre-concert talk of how he opened with \"Tunnel of Love\" the previous night). But it all worked magically. Bruce exemplified everything that is great about the human spirit in what to me was the most incredible live performance I have ever seen. His voice, the band and the incredible backdrop of the beautifully lit up Detroit skyline in back of the stage was magical. \"Jungleland\" and \"Because the Night\" (Bruce reminded all of us that he's also a great guitarist with a blistering solo) were unbelievable. At times the E streeters had Comerica Park feeling like a local high school gym. Martha Reaves singing Heatwave was a treat, and no Bob Seger, (he was backstage and rumored to join Bruce on \"Local Hero\") was a slight let down. Probably the most incredible moment came OFF stage. After this 3+ hour houseparty the band was individually escorted on golf carts from the stage to the dressing rooms to cheering fans in the outfield. One by one they drove by\u2026but the biggest cheers erupted when we all saw Bruce and Patty WALKING hand in hand through the outfield to the dressing rooms, and waving to all the fans. After all the energy expended in this 3+ hr. marathon, here was THE MAN, saying \"forget the gulf cart I want to let these people know we appreciate them\". Thanks for exercising the \"Demons\" @ Comerica Park with a Rock n' Roll Baptism!!!

Say what you want about the \"firsts\", Jungleland was absolutely PERFECT. And Because the Night was a personal favorite because I hadn't heard it live since the 78 tour. I think he's really torn up by Iraq, what with the opener, the Al Franken comments, the Cheney comment.

I invited my brother Tim and his wife to come in from Michigan, and it meant a lot to have them there for this magical night. Beside the music, the two best parts were the weather - a solid 75 degree day in late September (gotta love Denver!), and my wife who works her way forward at every show we go to.

I am my 2 buddies have been fans of Bruce since he came out in the mid 70's. The crowd was into the music and stood the whole 3 hrs. I have seen a lot of concerts but Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band are in a class of their own. Young and old were dancing in the isles. Everyone in our area were singing right along with us.

It was a long trip to get there from central and eastern Kansas. The show got started a little late, but Bruce and the gang made up for it! Starting out with 'Get out of Denver' that had the crowd on their feet and a rockin'. I would guess a little over 3 hours, only a break long enough for a drink of water. Four stage slides, and upside down mic stand (that got a troubled look from patti), and the splits twice. What a rocker!!! Had a couple of Bruce virgins that spent primo bucks for their seats up front with us. They couldn't believe we drove 8 hours just to see Bruce\u2026.well, that was until the concert was over\u2026.then the light came on. A great rendition of Kitty s Back on a request from an audience member. Bruce said \"We don t do this song much\u2026..but were gonna give it a try\u2026..\" You gotta love to hear him say that\u2026..two powerhouse guitar solos in that song with his 52' reissue telle. It just rocked\u2026and showed Bruce is a talented guitar player also\u2026 Seven Nights. Should be a staple of his show, it got people dancing in the isles, and I still cant get that song out of my head He finished up with Rosalita with Brendan O Brian special guest on guitar Bruce said\u2026.. You better know the chords You just better know the chords He also played on Dancing in the Dark, I hated that song when it came out, and the shined up for mainstream video, but, man oh man has Bruce got it right now! A wonderful way to finish off the evening! Me and my buds Terry and Mike are ready Bruce! Any direction North, South, East, or West, \u2026 He rocked Denver!

I have been to 8 concerts during the Rising tour and each of them has had it's own personality. Bruce and the band gave it their all in Denver, as they did in all the concerts I went to. There are always things to complain about at the concerts but I try to stay focused on the music and how I feel inside. I strive for the feeling of oneness with the crowd that Bruce and the music inspires. I don't get that feeling very often. It was wonderful to hear the old songs, the new ones and ones in between. Bruce and the others performed with such feeling. The line that stays with me is from Leap of Faith, \"in your heart, you must trust\". Bruce sang that line over and over with such feeling - it sure got through to me!! I felt that this concert was a little more somber than some of the others on the tour and I felt emphasis was put on the lines speaking of pain or injustice. It was also fun with many of the songs. Either way, it is inspiring to me. I appreciated the political statements that Bruce made - I feel the same way and am glad he is speaking out. These concerts have forced grief and other things out of me - that part is not fun but is healing. Bring it on\u2026 I love how I can hear a song a thousand times and will have a new thought or a new perception. I grow with the songs and the songs grow with me. I thank Bruce for putting out such heart and soul touching music all these years! Bruce and the band were outstanding performers during this tour. They are for sure heart stopping, booty shaking, earth moving, viagra taking, love making, legendary\u2026 I hate to see the tour end\u2026</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Roger</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">WOW, but then again how often have we said that about Bruce and the E-Streeters? I think a lot of people were put off by Mile High's (Invesco) previous record for concerts (Eagles debacle) but Bruce had the house rocking and rolling. How he manages to make such a huge venue seem like 'Mary's Place' and 35,000 people seem like a neighborhood party is amazing. While there were times you could tell that his was near the end of a long and tiring tour, and midway through Bruce seemed to be struggling to keep his voice, he somehow found a second wind and really brought the house down with his encores. Rosalita has always been my personal favorite and I had seen he had been playing it a lot in encores and as they stretched on I was afraid that it was not in the cards for the night, but I was not disappointed. Neither was anyone else there. BTW, Bruce did get a cold shoulder from some of the Denver crowd for his political statements but I heard plenty of cheers and no boos at all. Funny how the Woody Guthrie of our age has seemed to find his voice and finally speak out when we need him most.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Every show I go to seems to be better than the last. He was wild and on fire all night, he almost ripped his guitar apart and he did not want to go home. The music started and I taught I did not hear right CANDY'S ROOM OPENS THE SHOW? (When was the last time that happened?). That's when I knew he came ready to play. The set list was very unpredictable and therefore a lot of fun. We got treated to rarities like My Love Will Not Let You Down, Who'll Stop the Rain, Because the Night, She's the One, Across the Border and Jungleland. The anchors topped it all by bringing us an absolutely wild Kitty's Back, Seven Nights to Rock, Rosalita (wild and crazy eyes and all) and Cadillac Ranch. They even pulled out some Polka for us (after all this is Wisconsin) when Danny grabbed his accordion between Waitin on a Sunny Day and Two Hearts. Bruce seemed to really want to interact with the crowd and we got more than one Are you loose? and a lot of repeats on songs like Sunny Day, Because the Night and Seven Night's. He also mentioned that it s time to impeach the President and talked about how important it is right now to hold your government leaders accountable and to keep asking for the truth, especially when there are so many lives on the line. With artists right now getting in all kinds of trouble for voicing their political opinion, I am very proud of Bruce for speaking up and taking a stand on this. Watch out for the presidential campaign, I am sure they will all be Bruce Fans if it fits their bill. Seeing Bruce go at it with his guitar all night made me wonder if he was maybe just a little pissed that he and Nils did not make that 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time list in September s Rolling Stone issue. It was almost like, CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW? The band sounded great and Clarence is back! He had some awesome sax-solos and is playing really strong, which should give us hope for more tours to come. Bruce also put out quite a physical performance. He was all over the stage, did not just one but TWO knee slides and tried a little Cirque de Sole action when he climbed and flipped all over the mike stand. He looks like he is in great shape and one can only hope he will not take to long of a break before the next tour.

Thirty seconds after the band was escorted to the stage by golf carts, the lights went out and I heard \"\u2026\u2026 In Candy's room, there are pictures of hero's on the wall\u2026.\", in that rhaspy whisper that only Bruce can emit. This was truly the last concert of the tour (three shows were added at Shea Stadium later). Bruce played like it was his last. No four hour show, but it sure seemed like it. I wish I have that energy when I'm 54. Bruce's voice is like a fine wine, just gets better as it gets older. Kitty's Back was an absolute stadium rocking treat as well as Rosalita for I haven't heard those in over twenty years done live. The sound was great with a few early bugs. The band was awesome. \"You've got a brand new ball park here\u2026. it's real nice\", Bruce said. \"It's even got a roof\u2026\u2026\u2026. let's rattle it\u2026. 1, 2, 3, 4\". A bonus was seeing Bruce leave with the motorcade. I was on the curb when the band and he went by. He was hanging out the window of the van and I said \"See ya Bruce\". I got a peace sign and a \"Alright, Thanks\". Probably the last time I'll see him live. Good way to remember him and all the entertaining enjoyment I've gotten from him and his music through the years. \"</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Not last night. Bruce and the band sounded terrific, and the set list was a wonderful mixture of all of the era's of Bruce's career. The temperature cooperated, too. It was the crowd that was the big disappointment. In all of my 60 + experiences of being thrilled by Bruce in concert this was the worst crowd that I've been a part of. There was no enthusiasm whatsoever. Bruce didn't even need to ask for quiet before Empty Sky. It seemed as though, after several failed attempts to revive the audience in the initial part of the show, Bruce just concentrated on the execution of the songs. And the execution was excellent. The '90's songs were all highlights for me (Tunnel, Brilliant, Man's Job, etc.). Johnny 99 really rocked, and I just love Soozie's contribution to the band in general. Kitty's Back and Seven Nights to Rock were especially intense. Back to the crowd - poor Bruce didn't even have a chance to towel down or get some refreshment between encores for fear that the place would empty out! During Rosie and DITD he was able to get some response from the lame crowd, however. Overall, a very solid show, but if Philadelphia, Boston, Hartford or Washington had the honor of hosting the grand finale, any of those cities would never take it for granted as it seems the New Yorkers did last night. If they don't shape up, I'll never get my dream closer - \"Thundercrack\".

An innocent man was mistakenly killed, 3 NYC police officers had their lives completely ruined. The Rising tour is supposed to be a tribute to 9/11 victims, some of which were NYC police officers. I have seen him play this song in Madison Square Garden as well, and people either boo or completely leave the arena until the song is over. There is no reason to rehash this terrible event, especially in NY!!!!

I've been an avid fan for 25 years. Don't get me wrong, the set list was great. I loved how he dug deep into the archives to pull out gems like Johnny 99 and Kitty's Back - songs that I haven't heard yet on this tour. However, I'm very disappointed how he used this show to take an unprecedented 4 shots at President Bush. I was used to his \"public service announcements\", where he tried to be as nonpartisan as possible in speaking about the war. However, the repeated calls for Bush's impeachment was way over the top. I don't understand how quick he was to claim the war in Iraq was unjust - especially since all of the dust hasn't settled. If we find WMD in Iraq tomorrow, I wonder what Bruce's reaction would be. I suppose he'd rather have Al Gore be in charge on the war against terror - a scary thought indeed. I remember the old Bruce, when in the 80's was asked to comment on a political issue: he deferred claiming he was \"just a singer\". Well I wish he would \"just sing\", because he's a fantastic entertainer and a terrible student of history and political science.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Tom Cantillon</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Well, show #100 for me and what a show! The only flaw was 41 Shots, which I like, but just did not seem to fit into the setlist this particular evening \u2014 it drained all the energy \u2014 but only for a moment. Loose, powerful and high-energy show from start to finish. Souls of the Departed is simply gut-wrenching and gritty \u2014 should have been a staple long before this. Tunnel of Love was equally great, another song that would have fit in nicely throughout the tour. Brilliant Disguise was equally good. But Johnny 99, done rockabilly-country revved up, Johnny Cash meets Carl Perkins style \u2014 was awesome!! A tour highlight. Because the Night and Badlands are always a moment of that Bruce/E Street Band magic and a joy to behold. No Surrender was played passionately, but that 41 Shots just did not work, especially when backing it with Into the Fire \u2014 a very odd pairing. Who'll Stop the Rain was a great way in which to close the set and surprise. Encore time: The best, blistering, rocking Kitty's Back of the tour! Bruce and band just let the sparks fly and man, did they heat things up with that one \u2014 nearly burned the damn place down. Born to Run and 7 Nights are a great combo \u2014 a crazy moment of pure rocking celebration. Born in the USA is played with such ferocity that it's overwhelming to both watch and listen to \u2014 but great song choice as the tour winds down. I had my doubts about my 100th show, simply because it was going to my 100th and the 99th show in Hartford simply blew me away and would have to be, for me, just about the best damn show of the tour \u2014 sparks flew on E Street that night. 2 more shows to go.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Jay Stern</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Flew 3,000 miles from Los Angeles for this one.

This is possibly responsible for my now obsession with anything The Boss now does. The show itself has been savaged in some quarters for its political content. However for me any show is all about the music, and tonight was - in my opinion, breathtaking. Starting with an emotional version of \"Souls Of The Departed\" and then \"The Rising\", I have never been so charged at a shows opening, with emotion overflowing The Boss and The E Street Band put on a show that was so full of energy that you could have easily powered Manhatten all night. Can anybody honestly say that when you hear the \"1,2,3,4\" at the start of the last verse of \"Born To Run\" that you don't jump up punching the air.

Obviously, night three was special; this one did, indeed, feature a lifeless crowd and Bruce somehow ignored their indifference and the band played wonderfully. Actually, the only reason I'm writing this so long afterwards is for Ed, who I hope has reconsidered his decision to never attend another Bruce show for \"political\" reasons. Leaving aside whether an artist should or should not express political views on stage, two years, 1700 plus American lives lost, and many lies later, Ed, it's too bad more people didn't listen to Bruce's rantings and ravings.

Another Thin Line was very good, but the combination of Souls of the Departed, Because the Night, Badlands and Prove it was outstanding! The energy alone from those songs was incredible. Then came the long-awaited New York City Serenade \u2014 wow! A performance that was filled with some of Bruce's best romantic poetry and images \u2014 thanks for playing that one! The encores were a blast! Pink Cadillac had everyone up dancing and singing from the floor up to the bleachers. 7 Nights \u2014 love that song \u2014 Bruce kept the party going. And a nice finish with Twist and Shout. This show rocked from start to finish and by encore time, became one big party that seemed to be played in Bruce's living room, rather than Shea stadium. He has that way of turning something enormous, into the most intimate of experiences. Thanks for a truly great, great show. In my top 10 of all Springsteen shows!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">TD</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">What a great tour - it was so cool to run into people that I met at earlier shows. Bruce fans have this common thread of decency (for the most part) and friendliness that I will miss until the next tour (if there is another). But last night was ruined for me by one security guy that thought I was not respectful enough of his wind breaker. In front of a bunch of my employees and friends I was forcibly picked up and thrown out of the stadium during Badlands. And I am a skinny yuppie guy from the burbs with no intimidation factor at all. Pretty much sober (beers are 6 bucks, take forever to get and then it takes an hour to pee.) 44 years old, father of 2, never been in a fight with anyone but my brothers, did not resist, did not struggle. A lover not a fighter. Honest. We were in the front row of section B4 and dancing in the big walkway in front of us with a bunch a great women seated in the same row. The guard wanted us to go back to our seats, which I did - but I guess too slowly, he asked for my ticket. I said \"Hang on\" I guess too annoyed sounding and that was that. Without another word he twisted my surgically repaired shoulder/arm behind me and pushed me out. In a T shirt - without my sweatshirt, without any explanation or warning into the 45 degree night. I said \"really this is crazy - I have a ticket, you cannot simply throw someone out for no reason.\" His answer \"Watch me smart guy\" and then he ripped up my ticket. Wow. I was told by his manager that there is absolutely nothing I can do and there was no chance that maybe he overreacted. I guess he was a bully in school and now he gets to push around people. If this happened in real life, I would have had him arrested. Just incredibly unfair and very ironic - there is Bruce on stage preaching unity and peace and \"nobody wins unless everybody wins\" and question authority and I get tossed because I dared to tell a guy in a windbreaker that he had no right to hassle me since I was not hassling him.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Bill Noke</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">2nd-to-last night of the tour, and a true blow-out at Shea. Crowd turned the Shea infield into a dancefloor for \"Seven Nights To Rock\" and the closing \"Twist and Shout\". Bruce and the band emptied out the closet of rarities, highlighted by the hardly-ever-played \"New York City Serenade\", \"Janey Don't You Lose Heart\" and many more. Much more intense crowd than Wednesday's show. \"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Clete</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Night 2 at Shea was an unbelievable show where the \"power of rock and roll\" was exhibited by Bruce and the band in grand style. Bruce was a monster! When he opened the show with \"Roulete\" and \"Candy's Room\" before \"The Rising\" he was sending a message to the crowd, which I believe was: \"Buckle your seat belts!\" The power suite of \"Because the Night\", \"Badlands\" and Prove It\" without even waiting for crowd responses (no reprises during Badlands) was simply awesome. As has been the case all tour, set list selection was a joy (how can you not love a show that includes \"Rendezvous\", \"NY City Serenade\", \"Janey\", \"Pink Cadillac\" and \"Twist and Shout\". A good crowd reacted nicely to the intense performance. He didn't need to sing \"I'm on Fire\", because he performed like he was on fire all night. A wonderful show.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Kae</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">After seeing Bruce on July 26th at Giants Stadium, I was absolutely blown away by the intensity of this show. Roulette, Janie, New York City Serenade \u2014 rarities, B-sides, I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Candy's Room, Badlands, The Ties That Bind, Prove It All Night\u2014but I was especially blown away by the wailing, wrenching whirlwind of Because the Night. I've never seen him play guitar like that and it was a big \"f-you\" to Rolling Stone for not including him on their list. Pink Cadillac came out of no where, and the grin on his face when the audience realized what it was was as impish as it was in 1972. Now, as much as I didn't want to like the Rising album, he truly does the songs justice live. Mary's Place is romping, and Empty Sky is a haunting and poignant song. My City of Ruins, preceded by the standard publicity for NJ Food Banks, was chilling and haunting, from those first beautiful chords to those low, gospel-ly notes Clarence sings, to his pleas to his city. Set against the stunning background of city lights, it was a moving and uplifting night. The most moving song, however, was Into the Fire, dedicated to the young firefighter killed the night before in Queen who'd had gotten tickets for that evening's show for his 41st birthday. It sobered everyone up, and reminded us all who the album was really for. Born In The USA is only better after being played acoustically for so long, and while Dancing in the Dark is my least favorite, Twist and Shout was a wonderful way to end such an incredible show. Oh, and who can forget Al Leiter shakin' a tambourine on Rosie and singing his heart out? Almost makes you like the Mets. This concert was the most memorable thing to happen at Shea since the ball rolled through Bill Buckner's legs.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Magnus</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">The second show at Shea was tremendous, easily the best of the 4 shows I saw this summer in the US stadiums and of the 17 shows I saw this tour, a close second best to Gothenburg II.<br/>\nMy friend Andy and I were lucky enough to have GA tickets, and we found the floor entrance and got our numbered wristbands at about 4pm. When the lottery number was called, it placed us at about number 85 or so, but we missed the lining up, because we thought they wouldn't allow us in until 6 or so. We wandered off to meet some people in the drop line and when we returned at 5, the line was being let in. That sucked a whole lot, but we ran to join it, and ended up about 5 rows back in front of Bruce, in truth a great place, and surrounded by a bunch of cool fans.<br/>\nLots of fans were disgruntled with the first night at Shea. Complaints included 'only' an OK-ish setlist, uneven pacing and too much overtly political stuff. I personally would have loved to see a show open with Souls'?, but I was expecting something different to open this show.<br/>\nAnd so at 8.40 or so, the lights go out, the crowd goes wild, and the band comes onstage etc. you know the drill. As Bruce stepped up to the mike, I was wondering, as does any diehard fan who has seen a bunch of shows, what's he going to start with?<br/>\nAnd so the assault began with Max's frenetic machine gun drums. Roulette! ROULETTE! After my initial shock, my first thoughts went out to Rosie, somewhere up in the nosebleeds who had been hoping for the song, and the guys at Backstreets, who had put this song on their top ten wish list. It sounded as tight as hell, perhaps better than ever before. It was a real treat and set the pace for the rest of the show ' intense, emotional and relentless. Candy's Room followed and when The Rising kicked in at a much less frantic pace, the two opening songs together seemed almost like a separate preshow set.<br/>\nThe Rising, Lonesome Day and Ties, all standard songs were played to perfection as far as I can remember. Brilliant Disguise was next, and it worked far better early in the set than it had in the encores in Chapel Hill. By this time it was clear that both Bruce and the band were in great form and would deliver a top notch show, although the audience in general was good rather than excellent.<br/>\nEmpty Sky was great as always, and when Bruce went straight into WOASD (without You're Missing) I could tell he was in a fun mood. Waiting included the 'Once more if you wanna' impeach the president' line, indicating that the show would not be a complete reverse of the 'political show on the 1st.<br/>\nThen came a slew of great songs for me, both rarities and songs which I hadn't heard before with the ESB. Rendezvous was a curious choice for a tracks gem, but on its first outing this tour, it sounded almost as tight as it did back in 2000. Bruce shared the mike with Patti and other band members for the final 'I wanna' rendez- I wanna' rendez- I wanna' rendezvous' line. Another Thin Line was a big surprise. At the end of the last tour, I thought it was the only one of the new songs which wasn't good enough for official release, but I hereby take that sentiment back, and hope to see it on disc 3 of the upcoming Essential Collection. It sounds better on this tour than the last, tighter as if the band is more comfortable with it.<br/>\nThe next song was a highlight on an evening of highlights. Souls of the Departed was a song I had hoped would be a standard on this tour, and it was great to finally see it done with the band. Like most of the HT/LT stuff, the ESB play it loud and play it well, but don't necessarily do it any better than the 92-3 band did. The thing which made this performance stand out was in fact the lighting. Throughout the whole first verse, as Bruce sings slowly, the strobe lights around the stage give off a flickering white light reminiscent of the lights one might expect to see on a battlefield at night. It worked wonderfully. After the first chorus, the lighting went back to normal as the full band attacked the song for all it was worth. I seem to remember a Nils solo in there somewhere, but I may be mistaken.<br/>\nAs great as it was to hear a slew of rarely played stuff, Worlds Apart would have really worked well to bridge the gap between Souls and Because the Night. Because the Night is in fact one of my favorite songs, and I hadn't heard it live since my first show 10 years ago, so it was a great thrill to finally hear with the ESB. It's surprising that a crowd pleaser (and great song) like this has gone unplayed for so much of the past 2 tours. Clarence's short solo got great applause as always, and Bruce's guitar solo, gave him a chance to show off as well. It segued into a stomping Badlands, which went into surprise surprise'? Prove it all Night - played for the first time in a quite a while. I noticed at the end of Prove it, Bruce gave Nils the solo that he usually keeps for himself, which was a nice new little touch, although I prefer Bruce's solo.<br/>\nMary's Place was cut down a little, which was nice. At one point during the band intros, Al Franken made a hit and run guest performance, running onstage, kinda waving, and then leaving without making any comments or singing or anything. It seemed to me like a fun and appropriate way for Bruce and Al to express their mutual respect and admiration for one another. I seem to remember the crowd cheered so much for the band after the introductions, that he gave up doing his 'Shhh'? I've been missing you' thing which never really worked for me anyway.<br/>\nThen they brought out a standup bass and I thought they were going to do Meeting'? and then Jungleland. But no! From the first note, it is clear that this was something different. NYC Serenade isn't a song I ever expected to hear live, much less in a massive stadium, but they were actually playing it, and it sounded absolutely great. The band handled the merges between the different parts of the song with ease, Bruce sang it rather than speaking his way through it, and I think Suzie added some of her violin to the mix. I'm pretty sure it was better than it had been on the last tour. Hearing the crowd sing; 'Oh she won't take the train no she won't take the train' and; 'He's singing, singing'?.' was priceless, one of those wonderful Bruce moments you cherish and tuck away inside of you somewhere and never forget. Along with Roulette and Souls, this was one of my favorite songs of the show.<br/>\nAn emotional Into the Fire was dedicated to a fireman who was supposed to be at the show, but who had died recently fighting a fire. I think this song has been most effective when played on the East Coast, but it still doesn't hold water as a set closer. Thunder Road would have been the perfect cap to the main set.<br/>\nThe encores have always benefited from some spontaneity, and on 10/3, this is exactly what we got. Interestingly, on the written setlist it seems Bruce had planned on playing Kitty's Back, BTR and Seven Nights'? exactly the same songs which had been used in the encores the previous show. But instead of Kitty we got Janey Don't You Lose Heart and Pink Cadillac. Janey sounded laid back and mellow, played at a slightly slower pace than the punchy performances from 99-00, but the song seemed appropriate after Into the Fire, and Clarence handled his solo well. If I had any complaint about the show, it would be that this first encore set didn't start with the bang it merited. Yet Pink Caddy sounded far tighter than it had in Washington, with Nils playing the opening riff. These two B sides played side by side were the first songs from the BUSA era to be played. Born to Run followed, but it was really Seven Nights to Rock which really brought the house down.<br/>\nThe second encore finished the show on a strong note. Rosalita and DITD, which seemed almost like taken-for-granted fluffy fun in Washington and Chapel Hill took the show to new levels of energy, and got the crowd on their feet with help from guests Jon Landau, Willie Nile and Mets pitcher Al Leiter. Landau and Al Leiter (on tambourine between Suzie and Patti) both seemed to be having fun, but Willy Nile (folks, check out his excellent Beautiful Wreck of the World album) really knew how to rock, and danced around the stage when he wasn't trading lines with Bruce. Finally Bruce brought Gary 'U.S.' Bonds and Bonds' daughter to help out on one more song, Twist and Shout. It was an appropriate gesture to finish such a great show with one extra song after DITD.<br/>\nThe show clocked in at well under 3 hours, but it hadn't seemed like a short show to me. It was a great, exercise in extremes, from desperate to jubilant, to mournful and back to jubilant again. Consistently emotional and intense, the pacing was spot on. Setlist-wise, we had nothing to complain about, a grand total of four songs had their Rising tour premieres Roulette, Rendezvous, Another Thin Line and NYC Serenade, and several others were pretty rare. The encores started off a little bit mellow but by the end they were pushing the crowd to its limits. Sound quality in front of the stage was fine, and the crowd in the pit was far more into the show than it had been in North Carolina, but the crowd overall was less into the show than most of the audiences I saw in arenas on the last tour, which I suppose is to be expected. I left the Stadium, with the kind of 'Holy shit' feeling I only get now after seeing a very good show. \"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Jay Stern</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Simply the best Bruce concert I have seen in 20 years. High intensity fun and energy from note one. Clearly the best night of the 3-night stand and the only night that the place was packed to the rafters. A perfect setlist except that Tunnel of Love should have replaced Brilliant Disguise. Other than that, I wouldn't be surprised if this show becomes a bootleg of Legendary Status like 10/23/99 in LA. The crowd was jovial and pumped from the get-go. A Master performance.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Another invigorating ride over so many months for fans like myself has ended. Bruce really went out in style. Just as at the end of the reunion tour in NYC, this time Bruce was not overly playful, but rather he sent his message through the excellence of his playing and singing. The crowd knew what they were seeing, and they showed their appreciation accordingly. The rain ended shortly before showtime and stayed away for the performance, and the temperature was certainly bearable (much more mild than night 2). 30 songs, 3 + hours, many guests - it was just what a tour finale should be. Of course, seeing Bob Dylan onstage with Bruce was a momentous treat, but I enjoyed \"Quarter to Three\" with Gary US Bonds just as much. My personal highlights were \"Johnny 99\", \"Tunnel\", again the power trio of \"Because the Night\", \"Badlands\", and \"Prove It\", \"Back in Your Arms\", and of course, the guest-filled encores. As an aside, how did the author of \"Seven Nights to Rock\" write the perfect Bruce show song? Above all else, however, the image that I will always remember was during the final verse of the final song (\"Blood Brothers\"), while Bruce was holding hands with the E Streeters. The camera flashed a close-up of Clarence with tears streaming down his cheeks. I think that the Big Man knows something that we don't (or that we don't want to know). Thanks to Bruce for another fabulous journey. His art really touches me.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Neil</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">While the tour finale was a great show, especially with surprise guest Bob Dylan, there was definitely more magic in the night on Friday \u2014 the prelude to the last Rising Tour performance. Last show began quite uneventful and somewhat subdued until Bruce and band rocked on \"Johnny 99\" through \"Mary's Place,\" then quieted things down with a soulful \"Back in Your Arms\" and opening segment closer \"Into the Fire.\" What shows!

Bruce couldn't stop smiling during the entire song. New lyrics added to \"Blood Brothers\" (but different from what he added at the MSG finale in 2000) \u2014 a perfect, fitting close to the show and tour.

He started by tipping his proverbial Mets cap to the closing show of the Reunion Tour, opening now as he did then with \"Code of Silence\", and thus telling us that \"Blood Brothers\" was coming to close. But this show was much different than the close of the RT; although both had their somber moments, this show was also part celebration. The setlist speaks for itself, with the wonderful \"I Wish I Were Blind\" through to the very loose \"Quarter-to-Three\". \"Johnny 99\" was given the full band \"Hank Williams\" country treatment. \"Waiting on a Sunny Day\" was precluded by Bruce claiming \"This is the last dance, and I'm gettin' a little misty up here. Steve! Cheer me up!\" Light of Day was also a great RT staple, but this version was shorter (no \"train\" or \"I've Been Everywhere\" bridge\u2026damnit!) Bob Dylan\u2026what was it Eddie Murphy used to say about James Brown\u2026\"I don't know what Bob is singing about..\" but it was a very big moment for Bruce; the proud grin on his face almost saying \"Hey, this one's for me!\". Bruce became more talkative than customary, repeatedly paying homage to Dylan, saying that \"we wouldn't be here tonight without him\" and \"I don't know if great men make history or history makes great men, but Bob is one of the greatest; he made me think big thoughts, and got me thinking about the world outside my little town..\" After LOHAD, Bruce said \"Let's have a party\", and did his best Ricky Ricardo voice into \"Rosie, I'm Hoooommeee\u2026\". The two songs after Dancing were very loose and fun, with Garland J, Gary US (and his wife), Jon Landau and a cast of others joining the band onstage.. but after Twist &amp; Shout everyone quietly gave the stage back to the E-Streeters. They joined hands out front. The Big Man had the big waterworks going. Everything dies, baby, that's a fact. But the man at the microphone had one last thing to say\u2026\"Until we meet again\".\"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Pete</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Needed a couple of days to digest things, as I believe Saturday night closed out another chapter in the life of the E-Street Band. Bruce was beaming with joy as Dylan jammed with the band. It was weird, I got this strange vibe that Bruce felt complete - that it don't get better than this, if you know what I mean\u2026Very cool show - They went out in style\u2026on top of the world.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Tom Carpini</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">I have to admit I had mixed feelings about the \"last dance\". Deep down inside I was skeptical that the anticipation of \"the killer final show\" might turn out to be just hype. He can't possibly be consistently great in every show for 30 years running. Would this be the night it finally falls apart? Hell, he's 54 years old. Clarence has been collecting Social Security for a few years now. And I'm 51.<br/>\nBruce and the band have never let me down before, but I know that someday I just may be leaving a show muttering to myself that it's all over, no more glory days, ever again. Its inevitable, the law of large numbers and the natural order of the universe dictates these things.<br/>\nAnd that's the way it started last night. First the rain. Cold rain. And the forecast called for 38 degree weather. I was dressed for a football game in January, not a rock and roll show. I couldn't even show off my Springsteen colors under all the sweatshirts and rain gear. And perhaps its the jaded and native Jerseyan in me that knows these damn New Yorkers just can't throw a house party as well as those of us from the proper side of the river, and the NY crowd sure did seem lame. Hey, Bruce is from MY state. New York has no right to get this show. Oh sure, the audience kicked it up during the \"hits\", but the obscure and not-so-obvious song selections seemed to cause more yawns that cheers. Granted, Bruce pulled out some gems\u2026\"Roulette\", \"I wish I were Blind\", a smoking full band rockabilly style \"Johnny 99\" featuring in-your-face accordion and violin , and the gut wrenching \"Back in Your Arms\" all sounded great, but Bruce can't feed off off a lack of energy and the show just didn't seem to be the seamless effort I've come to expect. And Bruce looked tired, rightfully so after 2 years of concerts twice around the world. I was worried that this just might be the moment I've been secretly dreading since I was first transformed on a magical Passaic NJ September night in 1978.<br/>\nSo maybe I should be glad that the \"big one\" is in New York. If the very last show of one of the most successful rock and roll tours in history by the greatest performer over the last 3\u00a01/2 decades is going to go down in flames, at least it won't be in Jersey. No way this would ever happen in my state. If it goes badly, I'll be able to console myself that it's New York's fault. But man, am I ever worried that the \"last dance\" will be remembered for what it wasn't.<br/>\nThen something seemed to happened\u2026. the first encore, \"Light of Day\", although a bit shaky, showed a burst of Bruce energy and urgency that was lacking during most of the show. It was subtle, but I swear I felt the power. Next up, \"Bobby Jean\" ..it's one of those songs that sometimes seems right, and sometimes doesn't. It seemed right last night. Here comes \"Born to Run\", a no brainer\u2026 we all knew it was coming, but its always fun with the house lights on full tilt.<br/>\nUp next, the point in the show where the planets become aligned, Ying meets Yang, the baseball team pulls it out in the last inning, and everyone hits 777's on the slot machine\u2026.Bruce just smokes the audience with \"Seven Nights to Rock\", a song that I'm convinced he wrote in a previous life. Bruce and the Band have gotten my attention, and then without warning and no chance to catch our collective breaths, Bob Dylan descends from the heavens. Bruce lets Bob do all the vocal chores on \"Highway 61\" and never comes near the microphone. Class act, that Mr. Springsteen.<br/>\nA personal favorite, \"Land of Hope and Dreams is dedicated to Dylan in a sincere tribute by Bruce. \"My City of Ruins\" sends shivers up my spine, largely due to Danny Federici's amazing keyboard prowess. This just might be the \"show of shows\" after all. Could I possibly have been wrong about these damn New Yorkers? Well just get a load of this\u2026..Bruce steps up to the mike and breaks into the opening of \"Stagger Lee\" \u2026..\"The night was clear, the moon was yellow, and the leaves came tumblin' down\"\u2026..and in his best Ricky Riccardo voice, shouts \"ROSIE, I'M HOME\" !!!!!, and proceeds to rip into a rock 'em sock 'em \"Rosalita\". I could hear the dogs howling all over the tri-state area.<br/>\nThere is just something about the ferocity of the last few numbers that suggests redemption is near\u2026.and then comes that special moment during a Springsteen show that just can't be scripted\u2026.during \"Dancing in the Dark\", Bruce brings up the cutest 10 year old girl, all dressed in pink, for a little dance, and she breaks away from Bruce and begins hugging Clarence and Nils\u2026the crowd is wild at this point, cheering the kid on. When Bruce drops to his knees to dance with her, she does the same, and I'm here to tell you, that little girl damn near stole the show. So far, so good, and like previous shows on the tour, this should end it.<br/>\nBut it ain't over till Bruce says its over, and with no fewer than 16 people on stage including Garland Jeffreys, Willie Nile, Jon Landau, and Gary U.S. Bonds with his wife and daughter on vocals, Bruce and this amazing caravan of ragamuffin gunners do the unthinkable, the unexpected\u2026.a house party rockin' \"Quarter to Three\", followed by an equally shakin' \"Twist and Shout\", complete with a crowd sing-along \"La Bamba\" interlude!!!! I for one, am in a panic. If Dylan's appearance came out of left field, then then these back to back gems came from Mars. I doubt that these 2 songs ever been played together on the same night.. Shades of '78\u2026.I was 26 again\u2026. and suddenly, Shea Stadium feels like its in New Jersey, and my feet are really hurting. I just can't describe how happy I feel.<br/>\nThen Bruce sends all non-E Streeters away, and ends this madness with a tear jerking, moving, wholly appropriate \"Blood Brothers\". A righteous end to a righteous tour, and he sang it just for me and all of my new friends in Queens.<br/>\nThanks New York\u2026.I guess you guys know how to house party after all.<br/>\nLike I've always said, Bruce has never let me down.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Joe</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Wow. What a choice for the opener. Tunnel of love songs as beautiful as ever. It looked as if he did not want to get off stage. I saw 5 shows since the end of July and this one was like a different show with the new songs he was doing.

What a bittersweet moment. After 31 Rising tour shows, I can honestly say that this was one of the best tours Bruce and band has ever done. I truly loved the new material and found the shows as a whole to be very spiritual, uplifting, poetic, heartbreaking and sheer rock 'n roll bliss. I was lucky enough to catch the rough stages of the show at Asbury Park and found myself following the tour, whenever I could, to Philly, NC, SC, Albany, Providence, Montreal, Giant Stadium in good old NJ, Hartford and finally Shea, and I never got bored with the shows or felt disappointed. The music and the tour itself have simply been phenomenal and extraordinary on many levels. Bruce's music has a way of making me believe in my dreams, no matter how small or how grand, and for that, I will always be indebted. He makes me cherish the moment, and experience life on a whole new level. He has filled both my heart and soul with a passion that I try to instill in my teaching. His music and shows have become my church in both good and bad times and for that, I am truly grateful. Saturday's show was amazing, but not my favorite of the tour. Another Thin Line and Code of Silence are decent songs, but I felt for the last hoorah, Bruce needed more sing-along songs that were familiar, such as: Spirit, For You, She's the One, Backstreets and even Leap of Faith. Part of what makes the experience so enjoyable and overwhelming at times, is getting caught up in the songs and singing and dancing. Hard to do with lyrics you don't really know. Roulette and Night were passionately delivered, as were The Rising and Lonesome Day. I wish I were Blind was beautifully done, but a strange choice, kind of hoping for Price you Pay. Johnny 99, Tunnel of Love, Because the Night and Badlands were awesome and the kind of songs that were needed to kick the show into gear\u2014great choices and outstanding performances. Back in your Arms was a real surprise and simply beautiful. Light of Day was another treat, nice to hear once again. Love the combo of Born to Run and 7 Nights \u2014 lethal! Biggest thrill came when Bruce brought Bob Dylan on stage. Never would I have thought that I would see my favorite performer and favorite songwriter performing together \u2014 that moment alone sent the show into the stratosphere. They looked like they were having a blast, so hopefully that might mean more Bruce/Dylan collaborations to come. Great Rosey and Twist and Shout and a heartbreaking Blood Brothers. Some people might have found that to be anticlimactic, but it's a beautiful, touching, sincere moment and simply amazing to behold as the band holds hands and Bruce recites the added verse \u2014 very moving and a great way to cap the tour. Well, thanks Bruce and E Street Band for an amazing 14 months, 31 shows and endless hours of the best damn performance out there from anyone. You, your music and the band have come to mean so much to a lot of people. So thanks, for being there when we all needed a little \"Rising\" of our own. Hopefully we'll see you in 2005 with a new tour. See you, \"Further on down the Road\".</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">DJS</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">As usual, Bruce doesn't disappoint with his performance and song selection. Great to hear some Tunnel songs, the full band version of Johnny 99 was incredible and what a treat to hear Man's Job. Kitty's Back was the best I've seen him do (third time on the tour) - what a way to start the encores. I certainly could have done without the political tones, but I had no problems hearing American Skin. I'm of the mind set that this song is not a wrap on the police. In fact, since 9/11 it has a whole new meaning for me - get killed just for living in your American Skin. Isn't that the truth? Thought the crowd was awful. Hopefully it'll be better for night's two and three. And as a Mets fan, loved the exorcism to get rid of the evil spirits in that dump. Amen!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">J. Treehorn</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">All I have to say, is that I am blessed for having seen Bruce and E Street from my GA vantage point on Saturday night. I had seen previous dates during the summer at the Meadowlands from farther sections, and WOW what a difference. Being 15 feet away from them as they ripped through Night and an electric Johnny 99, I was in total awe. It was unbelievable. They sounded tight, Bruce was all smiles, and they closed it out in high spirits. Now I just hope that I get to see them all together one more time down the road.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Magnus</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">The final night of the tour was not quite the event that many of us were hoping for. Although it was outshone by the show the previous night, it certainly had its moments, and I'm very glad I was able to see the last show for what will be quite a while. Ultimately though, I was more than a little disappointed.<br/>\nThe weather before the final show of the tour was ominous. The GL tailgate in was great, thanks folks for bringing along that big sandwich and stuff, but few of us were showing off our GL T shirts, preferring to don all the warm and waterproof layers we had with us. After 5 layers I still felt cold. Miami Mark was looking surprisingly French with a little black beret, (that's globalization for you), and it was also great to see Zeke again, who I've been buddies with for 5 years, but only met a handful of times. It was nice meeting everyone, and I'm sorry to anyone I didn't have a chance to say hello to.<br/>\nEveryone was huddled up against the rain and speculating whether Bruce could top himself for the final show the next night. There had been a soundcheck which I asked specifically not to hear about, but no one seemed overly thrilled about whatever it was that Bruce had tried out.<br/>\nBy the time I got to my seat just after 8 though, the weather gods had smiled upon us it seemed, and the rain had begun to clear away. I was in section A6, one of the best non- GA sections, right next to the pit on Patti's side. From where I was, the pit looked filled well beyond capacity before the show even started. There was security everywhere, but during the course of the show they didn't seem to really do much to make me feel particularly safe.<br/>\nBruce took the stage after 830, as he had done the night before, and went straight into Code of Silence, the same song which he had opened his last show with, back in 2000. I've heard a bootleg version from Pittsburgh 02 where he changes one of the verses, but this version was the version we all know from NYC 2000. The we got the Rising and Lonesome Day, and to my surprise and great enjoyment Roulette again! Compared to the previous show, I don't remember which version sounded better, they were both tight and full of pent up desperation, probably better than they ever had been on the ToL tour. Night is another great live song which had been ignored for far too long, and the version they dished out just smoked, finishing with a flurry of drums. Max was definitely in form these last two shows. It all sounded pretty good and tight, so far so good. I hadn't heard the soundcheck, so the next song was a great surprise for me; I Wish I Were Blind. I'm not sure I really dig having a slow song before Empty Sky, I liked how ES was the first ballad after a slew of rockers, but IWIWB with harmonies from Patti sounded brilliant. This last month of the tour has really shone some positive light on the HT/LT albums. Some of those songs really work well thematically with the new material, and it's a shame it took Bruce so long to bring those songs out. I guess better late than never.<br/>\nUnlike the previous night, both ES and You're Missing were played. It was at this point that I began noticing how crap the crowd around me was. We were in some of the very best seats in the whole stadium, and people were yakking away to each other during the slow songs. At one point early on there was a fight behind me, and there was also some disturbance in front of me later in the show. When WOASD started, people started moving into the aisle, and security allowed some quite attractive women to dance, but hassling other (possibly less attractive) people and trying to get them back to their seats. People close to the aisle were getting annoyed at people dancing in the aisle in front of them, and a woman and her teenage daughter were holding up a very large sign for what seemed like minutes at a time in quite an antisocial way. It was as if everyone was pissing someone else off or getting pissed off. Security seemed inconsistent and at times belligerent. Maybe that's just the NYC crowd, I don't know.<br/>\nThe next song was definitely a highlight of the show for me. When he started it, I thought for 2 great seconds that he was doing Open all Night, which would have seriously rocked my world. Once the band got stuck into Johnny 99 though, I realized how damn lucky I was to see this little number live. The melody and tempo is largely unchanged, but when the whole band attacks the song, instead of just Bruce and say Nils, it becomes a full fledged rocker, not unlike Working on the Highway ' a dark disturbing lyric married to an upbeat tune. Suzie comes in at the end, kind of like she does in the present version of Darlington County, Cadillac Ranch or Working'? . In a tour that has lacked new reworked versions of old songs, this was a real treat.<br/>\nWe got Another Thin Line for the second show in a row, and it sounded at least as tight as the night before, growing on me with every performance. It was followed by Tunnel, which like Night and Johnny 99 had been played on 10/1. It was clear that Bruce was not setting out to play a setlist that would be wildly new and different for those fans who were seeing several shows in Shea. Perhaps he was trying to perfect songs which he had enjoyed playing the two previous nights. Despite this, the by the end of the show, he would have pulled out half a dozen tour premieres. Tunnel, which I hadn't heard before didn't do that much for me. Like so many of the songs, it seemed thematically out of synch with the Rising tour, and the songs before and after it. If Bruce had taken the relationship songs he played; I Wish I Were Blind, Tunnel, and Back in Your Arms; and condensed them into a mini set, say before or after Because the Night, they might have worked better.<br/>\nBecause the Night, Badlands and Prove it worked well as a combo both nights, but it would have been nice to have a different song in the post Badlands slot. I had overheard before the show that Back in Your Arms had apparently been soundchecked, so it wasn't the greatest surprise to hear it, but I wasn't expecting it in the slot usually reserved for old epic classics. My last chance hopes of hearing Incident with the full band went out the window when I heard the opening bars to Back in Your Arms, but in truth it was a terrific rendition, complete with a sort of stage rap about the dangers of taking one's significant other for granted. Along with the other relationship songs, Bruce seemed to be directing this towards Patti, and it a was a reminder of the inevitable strains that touring must place on their lives, and the sacrifices they both make in order to advance Bruce's career.<br/>\nInto the Fire closed the set again. I was hoping/expecting Thunder Road and /or Promised Land at this last show, but I guess Bruce wanted to finish on this note. Maybe I would have appreciated it more if the crowd around me hadn't been bickering about sitting, standing and dancing in the aisles. I do hope they keep the GA system on the next tour, at least for the pit.<br/>\nAt this point I was feeling a little anticlimactic, the setlist had been great, but the pacing and sequencing seemed off. I was hoping the encores could bring the show up a level or two. I don't know what I was hoping for, something rare, unexpected but simultaneously<br/>\nthematically significant. Perhaps I was expecting the unreasonable, I don't know. All I know is that for me the encores alternated between being predictable, disorganized, a hell of a lot of fun and downright disappointing.<br/>\nLight of Day was first, a great song that I never got tired of on the last tour, this time cut down to a 4 minute rocker that never really blew me away, but was great to hear anyway. No complaints though, this was like the third tour premiere of the night and a hell of a lot funnier than say, oh'? Bobby Jean. Then the band goes into Bobby Jean, and I can feel myself cringe. I don't know if I'm spoiled after seeing so many shows, or if the song just isn't very good any more. Sometimes it works for me, but usually it doesn't, it generally depends on my frame of mind. I didn't mind it for some reason on 7/1/00m, but tonight it just seems redundant. Clarence lets rip with his solo at the end, and holds that lost note better than he did at the 7/1 show, but he's played the song better before on this tour.<br/>\nThen follows BTR, which I have seen over 30 times now, and I would have enjoyed far more if the crowd had been just a little funnier and into things. Go back to arenas Bruce, please! It is always fun to hear Seven Nights to Rock though, and see all those people who don't know the song slowly get into it. By the end everyone on the floor is behaving like they are actually at a rock concert with the best live act on the planet, and security have given up trying to stop people from dancing in the aisle. Instead of building on that energy, with an extra song or two Bruce finishes Seven Nights, bows and the band leave the stage. The NYC crowd were terrible, there was hardly any applause at all.<br/>\nAfter the 10/3 show, I had expected and hoped for the final night to be the ESB only with no guests. I had figured that 10/3 was the fun party show with all sorts of obscure guests and 10/4 would be the E Street farewell show, kind of like 7/1/00 had been. But as soon as Bruce comes onstage again and introduces the first guest of the evening, I'm quick to take that back.<br/>\nBOB FUCKING DYLAN!?!?!?<br/>\nOK, OK, I can dig this guest. Never in a million years did I even imagine I might see these two musical legends onstage together. Bob comes out, his head bowed and hiding his face behind all those wrinkles and his nest of grey hair, and what follows was best described after the show by another fan as follows; 'It was crap, but it didn't matter.' Bob starts singing incomprehensibly, and only when he mentions a 'Highway 61'in the chorus do I recognize the song. Bruce lets him sing the whole song by himself, rather than duetting with him. Dylan finishes, shakes some hands with the band and then leaves. It was a historical moment. It sounded like a train wreck (thanks to Dylan's singing). But it was clearly a tremendously important moment for Bruce; in 15 years he'll still probably remember his last show on this tour mainly because that was the night one of his greatest musical heroes joined his band onstage. After a fine rendition of MCOR, Bruce spoke about the significance Bob had in his own music, being willing to 'stand in the fire'. After introducing the next song as one he wrote in that sort of protest spirit mold I was sure he was going to play BUSA, but he went into LoHaD, which was great to hear again.<br/>\nFrom this point on, the show became a fun, loose thoroughly spontaneous house party that went on longer than I would have expected. It was a lot of fun, but I've never seen a Bruce show lose structure and focus so much, and I was expecting a more thoughtful end to the tour. All the guests from the night before, with the exception of Al Leiter, returned and Rosalita was the most raucous version I've heard since 8/12/99. DITD continued in full steam, and then Gary 'U.S.' Bonds returned to the stage with his daughter and wife. As I hoped, we got the live staple from the 70s, Quarter to Three, not played with the ESB since 1988. Very very cool. I don't remember much except that the floor had turned into one big dance party by now. After the song, Bonds wandered off stage, and when Bruce called him back for an extra song, he took a while, clearly the next one was an audible. Twist and Shout kicked ass as it always does, but I had expected a more serious end to the show.<br/>\nThat finally came when the guests left and the band went into Blood Brothers. Bruce has always talked about living in the present, not laying back on past trophies, and for this show to end on this song, which closed his last tour, seemed to me a bit of a cop out. I would have enjoyed it more if the security guard next to me hadn't been yakking away to his friend, but ultimately this was just a slightly cheap way to end the show. It sounded exactly like it did last tour, with the same last verse and everything, but with the house lights on, and people already leaving early it didn't have any kind of the same effect. After it was done, Bruce said 'til we meet again' and the band came to the edge of the stage to wave goodbye for the last time in a what will be quite a while.<br/>\nI really wish I could be more excited about this last show; 30 songs, 6 tour premieres, 3 hours 20 minutes, and one of the longest of the tour. Ultimately, it seemed unevenly paced, thematically unfocussed and inconsistent, spontaneous in an almost unprofessional way towards the end, with various guests in the encores, none of whom who added much musically at all.<br/>\nIn retrospect the show has several songs and moments which will stand out for me, whereas at a great Bruce show the whole show stands out and there are so many highlights you lose track of all of them. I'm glad I saw the last show simply because it was that, the last show, and God knows when we may see them again. Clarence is struggling to keep up, and the whole band have other commitments now. But various band members have assured us that the E Street and is an ongoing concern, so I guess we shall just have to cross our fingers and hope to see them all again further on down the road.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Jay Stern</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">A show for the ages. Although not as electric as the Friday night show, the sheer importance of this being the \"last Dance\" made this a special night regardless. Hard rain and cold weather kept some folks home and, like night 1, the upper decks were empty. But, the extra-long set and the presence of Bob Dylan made up for that. I won't give the play by play as others have already done that very well, but i will say that this was a very special night and a perfect ending to a perfect tour.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

There's something about those four words that, for this long time Springsteen fan, makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside! Just driving through the cold, dark and otherwise lonely town there was a feeling of New Jersey musical history in the air. The show last night lived up to the feeling in the air as we were treated to seeing some of the most influential New Jersey rockers all performing together on one stage! Bruce of course, was dashing in his newly adorned suit, which if I do say so myself, he should be wearing more often! Max was tight as ever bringing his beats \"night after night after night\u2026after night!\" The MW7 brought those notable touches to songs such as Kitty's Back and Seaside Bar Song\". The guitar solos during Thundercrack were\u2026in the words of a wise musical appreciator \"life altering\". Not one note was missed or one chord misplayed. Although not a huge Bon Jovi Fan (simply because Bruce is the Jersey rocker in my life) I can say that seeing him on stage with Bruce as well as Southside Johnny, Little Stevie, Nils, Danny, and Garland Jeffries was a music lovers dream. It also was a Jersey lovers dream. All in all it was a mix of fun music, some new and some old, played by incredibly talented musicians whose appreciation and respect for one another is truly awe inspiring.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Tom Cantillon</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">\"WOW!!

Because the Night, Nils treatment, rocked \u2014 his guitar playing is extraordinary! Hold On, Thank You and Soul Man with Sam Moore were definite highlights of the evening! Passionate and rocking \u2014 simply terrific. And Bruce brings down the house with a blistering Kitty's Back \u2014 yes! The Sam and Bruce duet on City of Ruins was a soul-stirring moment.

It showed Bruce as a true American, and someone true to his convictions. The next group of songs continue to rock out in an unrelentening force. The whole evening, from Bright Eyes through REM, which played its more political songs, through the encores with everyone on stage, showed that there is a lot right about America, and made us feel patriotic again. It's OK to be patriotic, its not just the right of the Republicans. It made me feel better about the country, even if Bush does win again. The only down thing I notices wat that Clarence was either not feeling very well, or was relegated to a side musician. He was sitting down a lot, and had little to do. Most of the songs were not geared in his direction, and the solos in Badlands were short. Even in Mary's place he really didn't do much.

Bruce and the band put on a helluva an act. With Bruce opening doing the Star Spangled Banner, and then launching into Born in the USA, the show was awesome. John Fogerty was great, and the whole encore with all the acts on stage was phenomenal.

And although I am a Kerry supporter, I didn't want to be preached to all night. I was so pleasantly surprised\u2026<br/>\nTHE POLITICS\u2026 kept to a minimum. This may have been due to Kerry's whup-ass on W. in Thursday's debate; every reference to the debate was made with a smile and a puffed-out chest. Bruce and Michael Stipe came out and said a few words before Bright Eyes took the stage; short and to the point. The lead singer for Bright Eyes made a few comments during his set (including something about getting rid of the \"madman\" running our country). Michael \"We're R.E.M., and we approve of this concert\" Stipe also kept it short and sweet. Bruce had a few things to say, but nothing I would really call a sermon\u2026nothing as strong as his \"PSA\" before playing \"War\" on the BITUSA tour.<br/>\nBRIGHT EYES\u2026 is a nice little band, but they don't appear ready for the big stage yet. The lead singer could use a stronger voice. The arena was only about 30% full during their 30 minute set; I was starting to think that the Swift Boat Assholes for Bullshit or Rush Limbaugh's rehab clinic had bought up a bunch of tickets in protest and burned them with W.'s service records.<br/>\nR.E.M\u2026. I was not a fan before. I am now. Big Voice from that little man. And Big Energy. I don't think it was by chance that of all the bands playing out there in the great state of Pennsylvania on Friday night, R.E.M. was opening for E-Street. Mr. Springsteen and Mr. Stipe seem to have a bond.<br/>\nBS&amp;TESB\u2026 So, here we are, almost exactly one year since the last Shea Stadium show. Not bad timing. The first 8-9 songs\u2026there are almost no words. Incredible cohesion and energy. The acoustic Star Spangled Banner was very cool. You had to know BITUSA was going to be the opener. When I heard BADLANDS next, my first thought was \"it's too early for this song!\"; but as the setlist worked it's way through, it fit. I almost thought it was 1984 during NO SURRENDER. The full band version of Johnny 99 maybe should have been a gem saved for later in the show, but it was still as much fun as when they played it 10/4/03. YOUNGSTOWN was as powerful as it was on the Reunion Tour, and Nils' solo was great\u2026again.<br/>\nJohn Fogerty looked good and sounded great, but what was with all of that jumping up and down?But\u2026 CENTERFIELD was fun, and FORTUNATE SON was awesome,\u2026even if it is the Bush Family anthem.<br/>\nThe show lost a little coheshion from the middle on\u2026mostly because of the various guests coming-n-going; but it was fun to see the different faces up there, all having a good time. The only real downside was that very few songs featured the Big Man. That, and like 10/4/03, they should have led all of the guests offstage after PEOPLE HAVE THE POWER, and come back on for one more song.<br/>\nAll in all, a great 2-hour E-Street show, especially when many were predicting maybe 1.5 hours. Now, what's this about another concert in Jersey on the 13th\u2026?</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Up first was this horrible band called Bright Eyes. As if it wasn't bad enough that each song sounded the same, the lead singer was a kid who looked to be no more than 17 and was an exact replica of Terminator 2's Edward Furlong. Anyway, this kid was so full of anger and hatred and he kept spitting all over the place. And there I am wondering what the hell he has to be so upset about at his age. I wanted to punch him. Then REM came up and they sure know how to kill a crowd dead. They'd play one classic song, and follow it with 8 crappy songs that nobody's ever heard of nor wants to hear ever again. They played for over an hour and I recognized 3 songs. Bruce joined them for the last couple of songs, so that was cool. So while REM was playing, I looked over to my left and saw this dude. It was Baba Booey from the Howard Stern show. So I went up to him and shook his hand. He said that he just came into town to see the show. I didn't really have a whole lot to say<br/>\nto him, because face it, who leaves their house and expects to meet Baba Booey? So we talked for a minute and I went back to where I was. I kept an eye on him throughout the show and he must have drank about 10 beers. Springsteen came on and kicked all kinds of ass like usual. It wasn't as good as last year, but it was multi-band show. Even John Fogerty came out and jammed. The end of the show was one big encore featuring all 50 people on stage, but only 3 guitars actually turned on. It was cool. It lasted for 5 hours and Springsteen played for 2. I got to hear \"The River\" so I am happy. Never pass up the opportunity to see Springsteen.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Jamie</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Having a little time to comtemplate last nights show, I'm wondering how this group \"bright eyes\" ever got on this tour. It was one of the worst bands I have ever head. I remarked to my wife that I feel like slitting my wrists after hearing one depressing song after another. Terrible. REM wasn't much better. I liked the \"popular\" songs they sang (only three, especially Man On the Moon)but over all thumbs down. I thought Bruce and the band's set was really good. I especially liked the Fogerty/CCR songs and I wish they would have played a few more. Johnny 99, The River, and Mary's Place were also standouts for me. If your a Bruce fan only take my advice, blow off the first two groups, have a couple more beers, and just go in for the Bruce set.

Bruce came out at the beginning and said this was a \"No Bruuuuuceee ing zone\" at the start of the show I understand why he requested that but at $77 dollars for a ticket I think we should be able to Bruce all we want.

REM put on a very good show especially when Bruce joined them for Bad Day and Man On The Moon. Bruce and the band were great! Highlights for me were The River, Johnny 99, Youngstown (Nils killed), Centerfield, Fortunate Son and Because The Night (Stipe sharing the singing with Bruce). During the group encores Conor Oberst the lead singer from Bright Eyes was all over the stage obviously excited to be on-stage with Bruce, REM and Fogerty.

Don't know why this is. Bright Eyes is one of the best young talents around and gave me some hope that there's still some actual young artists around rather than the Britney/Jessica Simpson folks that climb the charts without talent or purpose and often times a voice. REM was loose, funny, and incredably energetic. Stipe is a born preformer, plain and simple. As for Bruce\u2026\u2026well that one goes without saying. The one for me that still stands out is \"Johnny 99.\" It was done much more rocking. I wish he'd release that on a concert cd or dvd. Heck I'd take a bootleg in a heartbeat. The band sounded great, Spot on as usual. The set flowed nicely. Adding a cover of \"(What's so Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding\" was brilliant. So, great bands, great sets, great night. Bruce was awesome.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I was the 5th person in a line that formed in the morning and sat there until we got our wristbands at 3pm. I do understand the concept of a lottery, but it was very unclear how it would work. Even event workers didn't seem to have a handle on it. Never the less, got in and got on the rail behind the pit. Shout out to Leslie and the other Greasy Lake people I met. About the show - what a awesome environment. Few things make you feel part of a community. Bruce shows always do this for me but singing \"people have the power\" with 15,000 people is a special feeling. Youngstown absolutely rocked, as always. Wondered if during Nills solo they always stand in a circle and watch him\u2026. never really noticed it but think it has meaning about community. Because the night was great. As was Fortunate Son. Pretty cool watching Michael Stipe standing 10 feet in front of me in the pit, just shaking his head at the devotion to The Boss that he was witnessing. Seems like Bruce should have wrote Peace Love and Understanding. He sure as hell knows how to perform it. Overall, great night. Would have loved a few audibles, but the band had to keep their portion to 2 hrs.

I seem to be connecting to Bruce more now than at that first show back in '78 at Munn Ice Arena, when at 16, I thought we were brothers. Fortunate Son went right through me, Peace, Love and Understanding, one of my all time favorite tunes, was off the hook. Live Bruce shows continue to give me the best experiences of my life!!!!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Aproximately 5 hours of excellent music, and the suprise visit from Neil Young made the night even more special. Bruce and the E-Street Band were unforgettable, as was REM and John Fogarty. It was also fun to see Bright Eyes, a new artist I had never heard of. The concert ended on the ultimate high note with all band members jamming together. Fantastic evening. I'm still glowing.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Joe Jenkins</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">I saw the concert of a lifetime Tuesday night in Saint Paul. The Vote For Change Tour billed as Bright Eyes, REM, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band and special appearance by John Fogerty. The show started at 7:00 at the still new and modern Xcel Energy Center. Mark and Sherri and I sat in the 4th row of the upper deck about half way back from the stage. Bruce played Master of Ceremonies and came out about 7:15 to say a few words of support for Senator Kerry and remember to register to vote but that mainly we are just going to rock! Bright Eyes started the night's rocking and featured an intense young Dylanesque type singer. They played about 30 minutes. After a quick equipment change REM came out and opened with \"The One I Love\" I have never seen REM in concert before. Stupid me, they sounded razor sharp and played about an hour. Some of the songs I remember were What's the Frequency Kenneth, Begin the Begin and World Leader Pretend. Michael Stipe, dressed all in white, was doing his spaz dancing all over the stage. About half way through their set Stipe says they have a guest and out walks NEIL F***ING YOUING! Neil played lead guitar on \"Country Feedback\" and then left the stage. I figured we would see him again before the night was over. Bruce joined REM for \"Man on the Moon\" Stipe and Springsteen traded lead vocals on each verse. Sounded great. Time for Springsteen's set. Bruce came out with a single spotlight and played an instrumental \"The Star Spangled Banner\" on acoustic 12 string. Beautiful. After that Bruce and the band launched into a hard rocking Born in the USA, Badlands, No Surrender and Lonesome Day with out hardly taking a breath between songs. Bruce had already sweated thru his shirt by this time. After a pretty version of \"The River\" that featured Suzi's violin, Bruce asked the crowd if they have \"seen any Canadians for Kerry, I know I saw at least one around here\" Out walks Neil Young. First they played Bruce's \"Souls of the Departed\" with Bruce and Neil jamming with some intense guitar solos. Next up was a scorching \"All Along the Watchtower\" with Bruce and Neil both singing and again wailing on guitars. Neil departs again and Bruce and band play a full band rockabilly version of \"Johnny 99\" Gary Talent played acoustic upright bass on that one. Bruce then introduces John Fogerty, calling him \"our generations Hank Williams\" John comes out to join the E St Band. Fogerty says, \"I have a final score, Twins 2 Yankees 0\" to thunderous applause. John sings Centerfield, Dejavu, and blistering E Street version of \"Fortunate Son\" John remains on stage and sings with Bruce on \"The Promised Land\" Really cool hearing Fogerty take lead vocal on a Bruce song! Fogerty leaves the stage and Bruce plays a \"The Rising, Because the Night (with Michael Stipe on lead vocal!), and Mary's Place. Mike Mills and Peter Buck join Bruce and the band for \"Born to Run\" Can it get any better\" Yes it can! Fogerty returns to the stage and he and Bruce trade lead vocals on \"Proud Mary\" After that Neil comes back out and him Bruce play one you just knew was coming, \"Rockin' in the Free World\" And man it did rock! Neil stays on stage, Fogerty, Pegi Young, and all members of REM and the singer from Bright Eyes come on stage. There were about 20+ musicians on stage! Everyone on stage to finish the night off with a rockin' version of Elvis Costello's \"What's So Funny About Peace Love and Understanding\" and Patti Smith's \"People Got the Power\". What a concert! I was drained. It was a four hour concert after an 8 hour drive that day! Plus I didn't get a lot of sleep Monday night because of staying up watching the Chiefs kick Baltimore's butt. Drove back Wednesday. It was worth every penny and every minute of lost sleep. I never dreamed I would see Bruce, Fogerty and Neil Young on the same stage on the same night.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">BT</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">At 7:25 Bruce introduced a guy named Bright Eyes, who played for 35 minutes. He was well received. Very young, kind of acoustic rock, a lot of profound lyrics, anger over this, despair over that. Hair in the eyes, ok band. Probably gets laid a lot. At 8:25 REM came on to a very enthusiastic welcome. They were also introduced by Bruce. Pretty loud. They played for an hour. Neil Young came out and played one song with them.. I do not know this band at all. They were into it, and had a lot of energy. The front man (R.E.M.), is an INCREDIBLE double for John Malkovitch. It was weird. 30 minute break. Bruce and the band came on at 9:55. Bruce started with a loud 12 string acoustic version of the Star Spangled Banner, and then the band went right into Born in the USA, and then right into Badlands. All this took probably 25 minutes. No screwing around. The night could have ended then. It was riveting. Then, also without any break they went into No Surrender, and finally calmed down and did Lonesome Day (not one of my favorites) The River followed that, and then (this is the song list per Greasy Lake) Souls of the Departed, and then Neil Young came out and they did an incredible, REALLY LOUD, long, All Along the Watchtower. My life and evening were complete at that point. Johnny 99 followed (if I've heard this live I don't remember it) and then Bruce introduced John Fogarty who started by yelling \"This just in: Minn Twins 2-NY Yankees NOTHING\", and then they did Centerfield to a totally nuts crowd. (Those who cared-and there were a lot of people from out of town(the show did not sell out until that afternoon)who did not care, really made noise). Fogerty did a pretty tasteless plug for his latest album and then they did Deja Vu, which is currently playing on FM (the closest thing to a protest song Clear Channel will allow, apparently), and they ended with a loud and great version of Fortunate Son. Bruce followed with The Promised Land (always one of his best), The Rising, Because the Night (with the REM guy, I think), and a long pretty good version of Mary's Place to ostensibly end the set. Mary's Place is not a great song to me, but it was well done and received. At that point some people not versed started to leave, but he had not played Born to Run and I just could not imagine that not occurring. He gave his little political talk (which was well stated and brief) , and changed to what I think was the guitar he had on the cover of the album. And they just flew into it. The building really moved. It shook. Proud Mary followed, which I could live without (I think the stage started to fill up at that point), and the last three songs were: Rocking in the Free World, What's So Funny about Peace/Love/Understanding, and People Have the Power. The whole set was about 2 hours or perhaps 2:15. Very tight, and the pure Bruce songs along with Watchtower were as good a group as I have experienced. A funny thing in the middle of The River. Our seats were right inside the arena, and in the middle of the song the game finished. It was on a huge screen not far from us with perhaps 500 people watching. So a pretty big roar went up when the game ended. They could hear it throughout the arena, or at least all through our area. Pretty funny. All in all, totally worth the effort. The political undertone added a degree of seriousness to the event, making the song selection much more meaningful. Since this was pretty much total preaching to the choir, there was very little proselytizing.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Mike Mosiman</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Well, this one was fun. Bruce really seemed to enjoy his role as emcee. He had a smile on his face all night and you can tell her really enjoys sharing the stage with the other artists. There was certainly a political tone to the evening (in the speeches as well as the song selections), but the music always took center stage. Bright Eyes was intense and he commanded the attention of those that showed in time to see him. I was never a big Stipe/REM fan, but they did a great job. Rubberband man Stipe was a hoot to watch. Fun to see Bruce play on those REM songs. The main event went on at 9:50. Great set overall. A lot of the songs were abbreviated versions (no ending guitar solo in BUSA, no reprise ending in Badlands that became the staple during the Reunion Tour) due to time contraints I'm sure. Highlights included a very intense All Along the Watchtower, a kind of rockabilly Johnny 99, and Because the Night (with the lights on) was superb. It was also a real treat to hear Bruce play Souls of the Departed with Neil and his feedback loaded guitar. Fogerty is awesome. He was having a great time. I love the baseball bat guitar he used for Centerfield. The set list was perfect for the mood of the evening. No Surrender, Badlands, BUSA, Johnny 99, Souls of the Departed, etc. all hit home to those that know the words. I saw FOR YOU on the set list (through my binocs), but The River was played in its place. They finally closed it up at midnight. I'm ready for the next tour. I never get tired of watching this guy play.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Peggy Hannan</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Bought 2\u00a0GA's below face on ebay can u believe!

My wife included. They didn't stay seated for long. In one of those I'd-have-to-see-it-to-believe-it moments, everyone rose \u2014 actually pulled \u2014 from their chairs watching Neil and Bruce square off during the solo. It was really the moment only two legends like that can pull off. Incredible amount of musical force.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

WOW! WOW! This was my 46th show, the first being on 9/30/78. I have an ever so slight tendency to hyperbolize when describing Bruce. I've left many many shows thinking I'd just seen the greatest rock and roll that had ever been or ever would be. It has now been almost three years and I still think this was the greatest show I've attended, by anyone, ever, including Philadelphia a week earlier. It certainly meant the most to me. IMO, Traci Chapman was a better opener than Bright Eyes. Her set included Fast Car and Revolution (or Talkin bout a Revolution?). REM seemed better than in Philly and Bruce turned Man in the Moon into a soaring rocker. Fantastic. Unfortunately, my wife, who rarely attends rock shows, my 8-year old daughter who was attending her first show, and I were about mid-court (no chairs). Michael Stipe introduced Bruce and while he was playing his 12-string interpretation of the Star Spangled Banner, my wife was approached by the man in black and asked, \"would you like to go to the front.\" Duh? He escorted us and another couple and their child who had flown in from England down to the pit. We arrived as Bruce was finishing the Nation Anthem. We had been concerned about the volume and had my daughter outfitted with ear plugs and sound dampening headphones. Not to worry. When a full band, almost heavy metal, \"Born in the USA\" shakes your internal organs, her ear protection becomes moot. Then Badlands, Prove It, &amp; No Surrender, HARD ROCK, ROCK, ROCK. That was her introduction to live rock - 15 feet directly in front of Bruce Springsteen and the E-Street Band playing as loud at the muther f**king system would play. The highlight I'll never forget was John Fogerty playing \"Fortunate Son.\" Near the end, with the females in my life at my sides, when Bruce stepped up to the mike next to John and sang the last chorus of this greatest of anti Vietnam war song, I've never been prouder - of Bruce, of John, of my family, of our politics, even of myself to have had the good taste to say over 26 years earlier, \"THIS IS THE GUY. I PICK BRUCE.\" My daughter's favorite song in the world was Mary's Place. Although he played only an average version, that is, a 12 minute, show-stopping, stunning performance of audio and visual art, I watcher her about half the time. I may be projecting, but she had a facial expression of mesmorized rhapsody. I just can't nitpik this four, plus, hour, show. And make no mistake, this was a Bruce Springsteen concert - there were two great opening acts, and a legendary special guest, but everything revolved around Bruce. Traci, REM, John, Bruce, my family, and a goal too important not to do everything in our power achieve: CHANGE. Memories of these shows became bittersweet a month later, after the election. I couldn't get out of bed the entire next day. I believe Bush stole Ohio. History has already proved us right. But the human spirit is resilent. As of this writing we have less than 18 months to tolerate this ultimate fortunate son, the worst \"president\" out of the 43. Tax cuts for the wealthy, shredding the Constitution, chosing politics over Science, New Orleans and Katrina, a catastrophic war based on lies, and so much more - can you E V I L - but worst of all, the torture - it's hard to criticize the barbarians when we're in the gutter with them. But I've never been prouder of any public figure, ever, than of Bruce Springsteen during the 2004 election, and this show in Orlando was the pinnacle. In fact, it was one of the highlights of my life. Thank you, Bruce. Faith will be rewarded.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Sandy Hickson</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">All in fantastic form\u2026 honorable mentions go to Johnny 99, No Surrender, Centerfield, Fortunate Son, Because the Night\u2026. the house was not quite full but nobody sat down the whole night \u2026 beautiful, crisp, up close and personal video coverage on the Jumbotron \u2026 acoustics sounded great and Bruce and the Gang sure looked like they were having a GREAT time!!! \u2026 Brian and I did too!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I thought she was pretty good and really hot! Bruce came out and did the last two songs with her. She opened with Rumble Doll, which I always liked. Kind of neat seeing him be a member of her band. He really didn't allow the spotlight to be on him. Bruce was supposed to introduce her, but the band came out and just started playing, he did his introduction, etc, after the fact. It seemed to take a while for Jackson to come out. When he did, I wasn't that into his early set, although it did include Fountain of Sorrow. But I had the same complaint about him as I did with REM, that they should have done stuff that more people were familiar with. Including the opening number, Jackson did 3-4 songs I didn't know, and they weren't that upbeat either. The set got better when he did Lives in the Balance and For America, which I hadn't heard him play in awhile. And I am a Patriot with Steve was cool, but a little rough. Running on Empty with Bruce was great, though. (Bruce screwed up the line '69 I was 21, he sang '65 I was 21) oh well. Bruce's opening was similar to Philly, then Eddie Vedder came out, and I think of all of the guest spots, he did his the best. He really knew the stuff, and was dead on. I'm not necessarily a big Pearl Jam fan, but Betterman was awesome. Clarence, Bruce and Eddie all jamming at the end. Apparently, Clarence has some hip problem, which keeps him from standing for a long time, and he needs help getting up and down the steps. But when he did play he was good. His days on the road are numbered, I suspect. No Lost in the Flood, however. Racing in the Streets with Jackson was pretty awesome too, The harmonies they did together were just chilling. The rest was similar to Philly, (but no Youngstown) Mary's Place rocked as always and was a little more elongated, with Bruce talking about how he had read the papers and saw that in New Jersey the race was getting tight, and him going off on that, then said he needed to get to the Meadowlands to straighten things out. (interesitng that he called it the Meadowlands, and not the Continental Airlines Arena). No guests on Born to Run. For the encores, they did 3 CCR songs instead of just one. The tradeoffs on vocals for What's so funny\u2026. and People have the Power were done well. People have the Power was particularly strong, with Eddie Vedder and Bruce just wailing during an extended jam, and they sort of ended and then started again, with the audience picking up on it and reprising the earlier pre-planned audience participation. (I was wondering if Patti Smith would show up, since she is from NJ). Had I not seen the Philly show, this would have been the better show, however the element of surprise had a way of making the PHilly show more exciting. Also the Philly show had more of a feel for the whole purpose of the show, where as this was a bit more casual (and disorganized) in some regards.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Maureen Shames</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Awe-inspiring is the best descriptive of the rockin' Bruce Springsteen and the E-Street band at The Concert for Change on October 13. Bruce Springsteen and the E-Street band were the last act to appear on stage at the Continental Arena. They brought the entire stadium out of their seats, dancing, clapping and singing starting with a rousing \"Badlands.\" \"Poor man want to be rich, rich man want to be king, and a king ain't satisfied \"till he rules everything. I want to go out tonight, I want to find out what I've got.\" Yes, the audience found out what Bruce has got. He is the boss because he is committed to an unbelievable quality in his music, lyrics, and showmanship. Every jam, every lyric is punctuated by an energetic move. His delivery envelopes the atmosphere, and we breathe it in, intoxicated. This description applies to every song he did, including the climactic songs - \"Born to Run\" and \"Mary's Place.\" During the latter, he appealed to the Swing Voters to stop swishin' and sashayin' and commit to a candidate. Bruce offered that anyone can be released from the burdens of Republicanism. He also played \"The Rising,\" an exciting \"No Surrender\" (the chosen song by the Kerry campaign), and an inspired \"Promised Land.\" A deep expression of patriotism was expressed by Bruce during a gorgeous rendition of Jimi Hendrick's, \"Star Spangled Banner.\" Some artists were unintentionally dissed, receiving the usual crowd- call for , \"BRUUUCE.\" Patti Scialfa opened the show with music from her newest album. She was talented, but after several songs, the crowd yelled for her husband. Gracefully, Patti told them, please, I get enough of this at home. Give a listen to her latest music, it's quite poetic with some New York City attitude. Folk/rock would be an apt label. Jackson Browne followed Scialfa, looking like he stepped right out of Rolling Stone Magazine from 25 years ago. Same haircut, same activist attitude. Jackson's highlight was playing old favorites such as: \"The Pretender,\" \"How Long\" and \"Running on Empty.\" Some of the new songs came across muffled, and we would have preferred more oldies such as, \"Stay,\" or \"Friend You Can Depend On Me.\" Still, it was refreshing to see this friend we could depend on, in such times as these. A nice surprise was the unexpected appearance of Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam on stage. One song he sang was requested by his friend Springsteen. \"Can't Find a Better Man\" was delivered with the typical Vedder intensity as if John Kerry possibly could hear this cry of support on the campaign trail and stay encouraged. John Fogerty sang old classics. We were watching history remake itself as he sang \"Fortunate Son\" and \"Proud Mary.\" Different people in this political cycle, yet Fogerty's distinctive voice remained tried and true. His enthusiasm was shown as he did his trademark hopping that punched up the protest in his songs. A glaring void at the concert was the fact that a former leader in the \"60s folk/rock political movement did not participate. Ofcourse, Bob Dylan could have added a special dimension with any of his vast array of music, particularly his bone tingling dead-on apropos songs such as, \"The Times They Are A Changin',\" and \"Chimes of Freedom.\" What vision Dylan had as a young adult. This was just a shortened group of the usual crew of artists participating in The Concert for Change, yet it still seemed difficult to fit everything in and after the encores, it was nearly 1 a.m. The artists never wavered giving every bit of energy to us, (with the exception of Clarence Clemens who appeared under the weather.) The political end of this concert makes perfect sense. Civil Liberties, stem cell research, the Iraq War, the struggles of everyday people to make ends meet are but some of a long list of things at stake, Bruce told us. We know there is much, much more. The Concert for Change gave me an outlet to express my political views. I brought a political homemade poster that said, \"Give the Boot to this Cowboy\" (with a picture from page one of that morning's Asbury Park Press of a dumbfounded George Bush). My daughter and I taped boots around the border so people could take one and mail it to Bush. We don't have to imagine how a government lacking respect for basic civil liberties might respond in a worse case scenario to us as individuals or to Bruce and everyone in Concert for Change. We learned that from John Lennon during the Nixon years when they refused him citizenship and had the CIA tap his phones. Outrageous. As an artist Bruce is inspirational, using his celebrity to make a difference in this effort for change. As a man, he is equally inspirational taking a risk by sticking his neck out during a time when people are being arrested for expressing civil liberties. When I vote on election day, I'll keep close to my heart the memory of this very moving concert. I'm crossing my fingers that the intensity, passion and love displayed by Bruce and everyone who touched the stage translates into a change in President.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Ralph</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">What a special night\u2026 but, then they are all special. This was my 100th Bruce show and my friends were out in full force - the Springsteen Republicans. Bruce was on fire. He juked with Patti, jostled with Jackson and showed a great deal of admiration and respect for one of his mentors, John Fogerty - and where did Eddie Vader come from. Wow. I fell in love this night. I was in the right place in the arena and in the company of a perfect friend. I was taking the usual rollercoaster ride of emotions with Bruce handling the controls. Up to the heights of the songs when I needed my dancin' shoes, and down to the depths of the songs when I needed to take a breath and be humbled. Bruce was never better. He was home in NJ, he was believing in his cause, and he was looking at the sun setting on this, his last show. The entire show was 5:15 long (the title of my favorite Who song) and we all left work early one day and never made it in the next. Nights like this come every night somewhere in the world for some luck souls. Tonight, tonight was my night. Bruce was as good as he ever was. If the poets don't know nothin' at all, then they at least know this much. Time Magazine's review of the album \"The River\" in 1980, as the Album of the Year simple said: 'Rock, as good as it gets\". Time to invoke those words again. Time to enjoy.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Brian Mac</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Better Man with Eddie V. had to be one of my favorite Bruce moments of all time.

So off I go down the Parkway to Asbury Park, and get there at just past 9:00. Saw Domenic and bought a ticket from him. There were two women looking for tickets also, and when they heard I got one (they needed 4\u2026) they asked if I needed a date. I said sure, and the security guard goes \"well, he at least LOOKS like Bruce\" but that was the end of that. I got in just in time for JoBananno and the Godson's of Soul who did a pretty good set. Bocci and the Bad Boys did their usual great set, including an always great \"All Along the Watchtower.\" At this point I am about 5-10ft from the stage so I was in very good position and sightline. There was a lot of hustling 'n' bustling (thanks Walt Frazier for letting me use this line) around me but it died down thankfully. One of my favs, Willie Nile was up next. This guy is one helluva character. He is a very talented writer and is very energetic on stage, always a treat to see. After him was Jeffrey Gaines, equipped with just an electric guitar. This guy was extremely talented, but perhaps too mellow for the crowd. He almost seemed to know that it wasn't going well, which was unfortunate, because I was really enjoying him. And then of course Joe Grushecky took the stage. I guess at this point it was about 12:45 or so and you could see some of the fatigue in people around the club. Unlike last year, I wasn't there from 4pm on, so, although I was a bit tired, I was still ready to go. Joe did four of his own songs, including \"Everything's Going to Work Out Right\" and \"Long Way to Go\" which were good. Joe's son played guitar with him, and although he's probably even younger than me, he's a pretty good guitar player. Got a lot of energy on stage with some, well, very interesting facial expressions (even more pronounced than Bob Dylan's random sneers). And then, it happened. My curse of Bruce never wanting to be in the same room as me ended, and out he came! As usual, the energy level just went through the roof. The band kicked into one of Grushecky's songs, \"Idiot's Delight\" with Bruce on guitar and backup vocals. Then that familiar but unfamiliar opening guitar riff of \"From Small Things\" and the place went nuts. One thing that was fun to see was that everyone in the crowd knew all of the words to all of these songs\u2026definitely the hardcore crowd. Very good version of the song, my third time hearing it, each time better and better. After a Grushecky tune, Joe prompted Bruce by saying \"alrite, your turn,\" which got a nice laugh from the crowd. A Bruce quadruple-shot followed, with a great Johnny 99, Code of Silence, Atlantic City, and Murder Incorporated. Code of Silence was good but seemed lacking in something, perhaps Grushecky's vocals although I'm not sure. Atlantic City was a fantastic version, as the \"come on and meet me\u2026\" part near the end of the song seemed to last about five minutes with energy building on each repeat of the line. And then \"Murder,\" which was the first time I've ever got to hear the song live, and what a thrill that was. Some fantastic guitar work going on with that. And that's one of the points with these Bruce club shows (my first!). He really lets loose on the guitar and you see that he's still got that Darkness era guitar work down in him somewhere. After two Grushecky songs, \"Talking to the King\" and \"Never be Enough Time,\" they kicked into \"Mustang Sally.\" This was another one of those \"only in a club\" moments, and it was a lot of fun to see/hear Bruce on his vocal turns, having a lot of fun and acting a little goofy. Then Bruce takes out his harmonica and I'm racking my brains to figure out what he'd play. He kicks into \"This Hard Land,\" which I was kinda shocked to hear in a club setting. However, this was one of the stronger versions of the song I've heard, with a real nice vocal performance by Bruce. At the end of the song where Bruce does the harmonica solo, he seemed to have a bit of trouble staying with the beat. At one point he even pressed his hand against his ear to block out everything. It was pretty loud in there\u2026my ears are still buzzing twelve hours later. Then Bobby Benjamin was brought onstage and sung happy birthday to. They brought out a cake for him and Bob gave his thanks to everyone. He also made a brief political statement, and referenced Bruce's \"Vote for Change\" efforts. This was followed by a surprising \"4 More Years\" chant from the back of the club. Kind of an awkward moment\u2026 Grushecky's drummer kicked into the opening beat of \"Light of Day,\" and here we go. Bruce and Bob traded/shared vocals on some parts, and Bruce had some scorching solos throughout the song. Only my second time hearing this one, and it was a lot of fun. In the middle of the song, before the \"I've been thrown out of work\u2026\" verse, the band went down and did a \"na, na na na na, na na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na\" which of course translates brilliantly into text. Bruce was at his absolutely goofiest trying to get the crowd to get softer and louded, also telling Grushecky that, if he wanted us to participate, he had to \"point to the crowd.\" This was a really funny part, Bruce using that Steven Tyler-esque voice to get us going. The band and Bruce did a fake encore here, as Bruce mentioned something to the effect of \"yea we're not even going to bother walking off the stage and coming back.\" Pretty funny moment. A bunch of the night's artists came onstage, including Bocci and Willie Nile at the beginning, and about everyone else throughout the song. The final song was a little Jerry Lee Lewis medley of \"Great Balls of Fire\" and \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On.\" Good versions of the songs, with Bruce, JoBananno and (?) doing backup vocals on the latter. The show ended at about 2:40, but the night was not over!! As I was walking back to my car with a friend of mine, I spotted Bruce's Range Rover parked behind Jimi's where the \"This Too Shall Pass\" mural is. I told my friend to hang out there for a second, as I ran to my car to get a marker and my \"Tracks\" boxed set in case I finally got to meet the man himself. After a series of people coming out of Jimi's, let out by the secret knock of \"knock knock,\" it was about 3:00am. Me and my friend decided we'd wait another 5-10 minutes and then call it a night. About thirty seconds later, out came Bruce. There were only about 15-20 people there prior to this, but once he came out another 25 people appeared out of sky. However, since me and my friend were the first there and closest to the door, when everyone came in we got pushed literally right to Bruce. It was like some magical force swept me over to him\u2026amazing\u2026and it happened so quick. Near the end of the show, my friend yelled at \"play Ramrod,\" and Bruce responded that it would be a good one. However, they didn't play it, so he asked him why. Bruce responded \"Well yknow, I was just goin' with the band, what can I say?\" A guy got his shirt signed; it had a picture of him and Bruce on it and Bruce told the man he remembered taking the picture. And then, it was my turn!! I asked him if he'd sign Tracks for me and he did. I told him great job tonight and with the Vote for Change efforts, and he appreciated it. He signed my \"Tracks\" and I was going to try to get out to give others a try. But I couldn't, so I'm literally shoulder to shoulder with him. A girl showed him a tattoo she had of his signature, and he gave her a kiss saying she desereved it. But after that, Bruce, obviously tired, said he was going home and thanked everybody. Only three autographs signed, and I was one of them!!! He got into the Range Rover and sped off, and that was that. I'll tell you one thing though, I have never felt more alive and energized at 3:00am than ever before in my life. What a night!!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>Scooter</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Bruce was there early\u2026 spent most of the time at the mixing board\u2026 Many who were in the special smoking area directly behind the mixer did not recognize him (most kept asking, \"is Bruce going to show?\"\u2026\u2026 He then joined Joe G at about 12:45 am and played till 2:20am\u2026..</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Scott Kern<br/>\n(with Fran, Kevin and Jack)</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">\"Seaside Bar Song\". The juke joint's hummin', everybody came down Little Willie and the Soul Brooms layin' down all his stuff now. We were disciples of the late great Philly DJ, Ed Sciaky, who weaned us on Born to Run as teenagers living in New Jersey suburbia in the mid-70's. I was 19 years old with my then girlfriend (later wife, Marie Mazzochetti) when we saw our first Springsteen concert, 15 rows back on the floor, for Show #6 at The Spectrum on July 19, 1981. His music is the soundtrack to my life as we continued to follow his career and go to his shows with the dream of seeing him in a very intimate venue before I died.. Sometimes in life, persistence pays off. This is our story. Last night the ghosts of thousands of unknown and forgotten Jersey Shore bar bands from the past, along with the spirit of James Brown, Van Morrison, AM Radio, Joni Mitchell, The Ramones, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix and the 60?s sounds of R&amp;B and Soul all converged on the beach town of Asbury Park last night in honor of the 5th Annual Light of Day shows benefiting Parkinson?s Disease and Muscular Dystrophy. The Whiz Bang Gang from Uptown arrived shortly after 6pm and took up residence center stage in front of the soundboard and settled in for a night of music and hope. Hey Waldo, quick turn around. Bruce Springsteen is standing about five feet behind us, behind the soundboard watching Boccigalupe and The Bad Boys (band) just like us!!! It was now 12:40am. We and the rest of the crowd had now been standing for almost seven hours listening to great music. Believe me, NO ONE was leaving the bar now! The Pony was packed to capacity with a few hundred people waiting for Joe Grushecky &amp; The Houserockers to take the stage, knowing full well that the rumored musical guest was in the house. The energy in the joint was enough to light up the Asbury Park Boardwalk from the Casino to Convention Hall!!! Grushecky and his band played a couple numbers capturing that Steel City blue collar music inspired by years of collecting old 45s when he looked stage right and welcomed Bruce Springsteen to the stage to a thunderous applause from the fans! Okay \u2014 I'm standing in the legendary Stone Pony on a Saturday night and Bruce Springsteen is on stage playing guitar about 50 feet in front of me. Is this a dream? The band broke into FROM SMALL THINGS (BIG THINGS ONE DAY COME) with everyone in the crowd singing along. Springsteen was soloing like a madman, smiling ear to ear. JOHNNY 99 also from Nebraska was much like the version he played during the Vote For Change shows. Again, Bruce was doing his best Neil Young impersonation of pounding on his Telecaster. CODE OF SILENCE was the next obvious choice, representing a song that Grushecky penned in 1997 appearing on the recent Essential Springsteen 3 CD collection. Next was ATLANTIC CITY with his acoustic introduction that broke into a full band electric version. Amazing bar-room version!! Grushecky's teenage son joined the band for an over-the-top version of MURDER INC. playing guitar next to Bruce Springsteen. I guess he'll have some interesting stories to tell his high school buddies on Monday morning. Rockin' version of Wilson Pickett's MUSTANG SALLY with everyone singing along!!! THIS HARD LAND was a welcome treat from Tracks box set which had Springsteen playing harmonica while we all wondered if the song would possibly be Thunder Road or maybe something from the Darkness album. This was even better! What a treat!!!! LIGHT OF DAY was the encore with the founder Bob Benjamin (afflicted with Parkinson's) joining Springsteen and Grushecky for a loud BUT touching version of the song from the 1987 Michael J. Fox movie of the same name with the song lyrics. \"I got a little lost along the way, but I'm just around the corner to the light of day.\" The crowd was singing along at a feverish pitch not wanting THIS moment to end!!!! The rest of the musicians joined Springsteen for a closing 60's medley of R&amp;B songs including GREAT BALLS OF FIRE/SHOUTWHOLE LOTTA SHAKIN' GOING ON. It was nearly 2:30am when the house lights came on and we filed out into the blackness of 2nd and Ocean Avenues. Dream realized\u2026 We were floating on a cloud!!!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Great fun.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Pete</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">I knew this would be probably my only chance to see him up close and personal. And man, did I get up close. Flood Aid was all about hope, overcoming adversity and setting things right. So it's no wonder Bruce was eager to step up and do his part \u2014 because that's what he does. So he joined Joey G for a night of remarkable music and solidarity. From the beginning, he made it clear that this night was not about him. It was about the people he came to help and the talent that made this union possible. He opened the night with a short and simple impromptu emcee address. \"There's a lot of young talent on stage here tonight\" he remarked above a chorus of awe-inspired cheers. \"No Bruuucing tonight or I'll have to get medieval on your ass\". And with that he introduced Johnny Grushecky, Joe's son to the crowd. An introduction by The Boss \u2014 can a career begin any better for a 16 year old? Pittsburgh is a place of people used to giving. On Thursday they came to give support to flood victims. They came to give support for local music. They came to see Springsteen. There was no doubt. Joe Grushecky may be The Burgh's favorite rock and roll son, but Bruce is their adopted brother. He was there in the 80's when the mills went down and needed inspiration and support (and cash). He was there in the 90's for the Rainbow kitchen and its army or volunteers and the thousands of homeless that relied on it to get back on their feet. Bruce was there again on Thursday and spared nothing. He gave of his heart and gave from his pocket (Springsteen paid for all the t-shirts and donated all the profits to the Salvation Army for the flood relief). A 2,700 seater with near-perfect acoustics, Heinz Hall was made for Bruce. Exit 105 made an unpublicized appearance and provided the audience with the vehicle for Bruce's first treat of the night. Befittingly, Bruce would join his Jersey brethren for an incredible cover of \"All Along the Watchtower\". I've never heard it played with so much power. He squeezed every note out of it. A tease of things to come. The evening was half way over before Springsteen would again grace the night. Joey G and the House Rockers were next and I knew if I ever wanted to fulfill my hopes of seeing Bruce up close, this would probably be my only chance. I left my back row seat and nonchalantly worked my way up to the low wall that separated the special seating in the orchestra pit and the front row seats. The somewhat reserved crowd of mostly middle-aged concert goers didn't mind. There were no security personnel to kick me back. I though I might have a chance. The lights dimmed. The organized commotion begin. The crowd's respectful demeanor turned into anxious delight. All eyes were on the darkened stage when I made my move down the pit's steps and walked across floor in front of the stage. I settled just to the right of the last folding chair directly in front of the stage. I acted like I was supposed to be there \u2014 after all, I was. Bruce entered stage right and I thought this would be about the time I would get the tap on my shoulder and wake up, or at least have to go back to my seat. It didn't come. Instead a resounding \"If I Should Fall Behind\" filled the venue air. The shock waves of emotion rippled back through the crowd as the lone poet reminded us of how we are all in this together. The flood victims. The Country. Life itself. Whatever your interpretation, it was profound. The last chord strummed and the roar picked up again. Not the typical sonic boom of applause we're accustomed to in the arenas or stadiums, but in a way, it seemed to embody a more appreciative tone. \"Land of Hope and Dreams\", a song normally reserved as a sign off for the E Street Band, made its way into the front end of his performance. Again, another acoustic solo. I was still mesmerized watching him make the make music I so much adore when he broke into \"For You\" \"For All the Old Fans\". It was a not-so-subtle statement that he was here to help. Ironically, the audience motioned by the ir united chorus that they largely \"came For You\" Bruce. Joey G and the band joined Bruce on stage for the remainder of the show. A jam perfectly rationed with Joe and Bruce songs including \"Code of Silence\" and \"Never be Enough Time\" both co-written by these long-time friends. As far as Bruce fare, the other choice selections included \"From Small Things\", \"Johnny 99\", \"Atlantic City\" (my favorite full band of the evening), a rare appearance of \"Factory\", \"Murder Incorporated\", \"This Hard Land\" and \"Lucky Town\". Finally, the evening kicker, the seasonal classic \"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\" with the entire cast of performers joining Bruce on stage. I was hoping to get a hand slap from Bruce as he made his way off stage. But I was reminded that this wasn't about him. Maybe at a different show at different place for a different reason, I would have gotten one. Instead he looked down and smiled as if to say \"I know you enjoyed it, let's remember why we're here and leave it at that\". There's no way I could be disappointed after a night like that. So we respected his humble wishes and waved instead. On the backstreets behind Heinz Hall as the other performers dashed into their awaiting limos, I saw Joe and Bruce pull up to the red light in an SUV. Joe was chauffeuring. Bruce gave the thumbs up from the passenger side to the guy and girl who managed to spot him. They held up their Born to Run vinyls and Sharpies. They didn't get the autographs, but I think they were content with the thumps up. They smiled and just left it at that.\"</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Some five hundred fans gathered for the Bruce Springsteen and Friends Holiday show at Harry's Roadhouse in downtown Asbury Park on December 19 at 8:30 p.m. Playing with The Boss were Bobby Bandiera and friends, plus the Jukes horns and guests Patti Scialfa, Max Weinberg and Willie Nile. Greasy Lake Web Site was denied access to this historical holiday show by Shore Fire Media, Bruce's publicist. I'm sure that they didn't mean to put some proverbial coal in our stocking, but tickets to this small venue were in high demand. Of course, it didn't stop us because we were \"Born to Run\" a review of Bruce here at Greasy Lake. This is the perfect holiday rock story. It is meaningful how Bruce is transforming his city of ruins, Asbury Park into a thriving scene through good 'ol rock and roll fundraising. In order to win one of the 10 pairs of tickets to the show and to meet Bruce, fans had to fill out forms at shops in Asbury Park, thus increasing holiday business. In addition, funds from the concert were given to eleven city based charities including the Boys and Girls Clubs of Monmouth County, The Salvation Army and The Center, which provides help to those living with AIDS or HIV. Tickets each sold at $100 a pop, but were completely sold out within minutes. Dozens of die-hard fans were unable to purchase or win a ticket, but hoped a miracle would get them in the door. They stationed themselves outside of Harry's in the bitter wet snowy weather from 8:30 p.m. until about 11:30 p.m. Two large speakers broadcast a set that would bring a variety of sentimental and spirited songs to us, causing us to dance, sing and enjoy every second of what would be a most memorable experience! \"For You\" was a perfect acoustic opener. \"Remember how I poured salt on your tongue and hung just out of reach\" was a stingingly appropos moment. Yes, Bruce, you were out of reach, but the spice of hearing your voice, just a few feet away was worth this slight devastation. \"Talk to Me,\" a song Bruce wrote for Southside Johnny had a really rockin' fun beat and was a reminder of the old college days. The group outside was dancing and that was the best way to stay warm and happy! Hearing \"Spirit In the Night\" sounded like a personal plea directly from Bruce for any Greasy Lake reviewers to kindly enter Harry's and provide the best coverage. Security was visibly tight, as a security guard physically grabbed and threw out one avid fan from Harry's for crashing her way in. \"If I Should Fall Behind\" was an acoustic number, and it happens to be one of my all-time favorite Bruce ballads. Bruce sang solo, and Little Steven's vocals were missed. I think this song fares best with the entire E-Street band. Furthermore, it is a better choice for Bruce and Patti to sing, \"If I Should Fall Behind\" together rather than the surprise selection, \"It Takes Two.\" The Springsteen/Scialfa duo must have chosen, \"It Takes Two\" as some kind of joke, or perhaps to please a friend or relative. It had a retro Donnie and Marie vibe, but bubblegum music doesn't fit their rockin' repertoire. I'd prefer to hear Patti sing any number of folk/rock tunes from one of her own albums than this. Two energetic high points in the show were \"Waitin' On a Sunny Day,\" and \"Tenth Avenue Freezeout.\" Many people were also hoping for the commercially successful \"Thunder Road\" and/or \"Born to Run\" but these old favorites were never played. Election 2004 is our disappointing history, but Bruce still sang, \"What's So Funny About Peace, Love and Understanding.\" We had heard it at the Concert for Change finale at Continental Airlines Arena on October 13. It lent itself to the Christmas mood, and it was refreshing to hear this song once popularized as a cover by Elvis Costello. People flashed the peace sign to one another throughout the tune. When \"Hava Nagila\" was played some fans started to do the Horah! Was it played at the request of Max Weinberg, a Jew born to drum? During a former interview with Weinberg, he disclosed that prior to fame he had once played in a Bar/Bat Mitzvah/wedding band. It was funny to hear these artists include this festive Jewish traditional song among rock and roll tunes. If there had been chairs, we would have taken turns lifting each other into the air. Bruce, who is surely a Santa Claus figure in Asbury Park brought some magic to his anticipated holiday anthem, \"Santa Claus is Coming to Town.\" Fans waved their arms to the beat of this joyous seasonal song. \"Merry Christmas Baby\" shined with uplifting sentiment and some strong energy. Fans knew that they better watch out, and we all did\u2026 for Bruce. We took turns peaking through slits in the window treatments in an attempt to see him all evening long. It was difficult, but we could just make out the tip of Bruce's head. While enjoying the music, things sometimes got silly outside. We took pictures of the speakers because on this night they served as an auditory representative of THE real live Bruce \u2014 or at least the closest thing we had to him. When Irene Feldman, a local fan requested that a security guard hand her note to the band, she was told nothing could be delivered to them because of safety concerns. By the end of the evening, the outdoor die-hard crowd dwindled down to about 25 . We persevered the elements, bonded together, and had shared a rock and roll highlight that brought a glow to the holiday season. Make no mistake about it, there were chattering teeth and numb extremities for those who refused to miss one song. Not only was the concert worth every bit of pain, but it proved to be the best gift of the holiday season. An unexpected reward was reaped after the show, when Bruce and Patti walked closely past us while being escorted to their vehicle. A member of Bruce's staff had prepped the small crowd that Bruce should not sign autographs since he reportedly was feeling ill. Several people ignored that request, asking \"Mr. Springsteen\" to autograph items. In the true Christmas spirit, Bruce graciously fulfilled each of these wishes. Bruce looked wonderfully fresh, wearing a similar cool black wool hat that I was also wearing! Patti looked very pretty, as she was whisked away. I hoped Bruce, Patti and their friends know how much they are appreciated not only for their music, but for having kind hearts. I'm sure this effort to improve Asbury Park will be met with success in many ways. Now, Asbury Park is definitely on my shopping radar. On a personal level, Bruce will always remain an inspiration. To the Springsteen family, I just want you to know how loved your concert was by all the fans we met. So, be sure to have a \"merry Christmas baby\" and a very happy and healthy New Year!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Took a late night flight into Newark, waited in the Airport from Midnight to 6am. At 6am I took the Long Branch Line out of the Airport up the Jersey Coast. BIG MISTAKE, not so much the train, but the time. Scariest friggin' experience ever for a young midwestern boy. Two guys behind me talking about getting out of a murder rap, I'm not even joking (I wish I was). All is well though. North Elizabeth, Amboy, Middletown\u2026. RED BANK! Time to exit the nice train. I would have probably jumped off by that point. It's kind of early, but Red Bank looks cool, resort town. Jersey has a similar look and appeal to the North Shore of Minnesota. First thing I do is go into the train station and there are \"pictures of my hero up on the wall\", put a smile on my face to see these candid shots. So, I get to the hotel, the Molly Pitcher Inn, tell them I'm on no sleep. OOPS, we lost your reservation. Showed them the online confirmation, yelled at them a bit, got a room. Sweet Sleep. Got up at noon, went and had lunch down in the lobby. Fru-Fru restaurant, here goes my life savings. It was very good, elegant (a.k.a. - I felt out of place). Went out to explore a little bit before the ticket pick-up. Saw the town, pretty cool. Came back, watched \"Bend It Like Beckham\" on the tele (funny film in a \"Big Fat Greek Wedding\" sort of way). Went down to the lobby, then to the Penbrook Room at 3 for the Ticket Pick Up. Hordes of Bruce Junkies, some faces I recognize, some I don't. Met a couple of cool people, they all seemed generally intrigued by the fact that I had flown in on the drop of a hat to see the Boss. A lot of Jerseyites. Chatted, played with my \"Prove It All Night\" ringtone on my phone, got my ticket. I look down, can it be? The ticket reads: Center Section, Seat 102. Now either this is either a really friggin' awesome seat or a middle of the pack if they start out the seats at 1. Well, dreams do come true. I was FRONT ROW, MIDDLE SECTION, RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE MAN, MAYBE 4-5 feet away. Now I've been front row pit before but this is something entirely different. VH1 guy came down before the show started, yelled at mme because I brought a pad of paper and a pen (just incase \u2014 C'mon, how many times was I gonna be in Jersey this close to Bruce). Told me to put it away, was afraid I was gonna lunge at Bruce cause I was front row. I was frustrated. He then said that I shouldn't worry too much, everyone will know I was here and that it really happened because I'll be on TV alot because of the front row seating. This was getting awesome. Flash forward, Kevin's out playing with the guitars, I'm giddy. He gets a big applause for a soundcheck, he laughs. Bruce comes out, I wet myself (well not really, but just about). I'm shaking and pounding my fists (which to my dismay I'm sure everybody here will see on the 23rd. I'll be the one in the blue short sleeve shirt, brown khakis and glasses for those who wish to make fun of me come then.) He says \"Hi\", launches into it. Devils and Dust is first, and is flawless. Didn't love it on first listen or second, but Bruce really made it work for me yesterday night. His accoustic strum-drumming works and is really powerful. Really powerful. I have a feeling most of these songs from D&amp;D will be better on tour than on the album, but who knows. Next, Blinded by the Light, Bruce talking douches again. Funny stuff. 3rd Song, Brilliant Disguise, nice to hear it, Patti comes out, she's looking pretty hot but something's not working too well with here voice. She biffs it a couple times, Bruce doesn't seem to want to stop. I'm not even a Patti basher, but she was more of a detractor than anything else last night. 4th song, Nebraska, a welcome rendition that was played 2 times (Bruce keeps forgetting his harmonica). 5th Song \u2014 HIGHLIGHT OF THE NIGHT: Jesus was an Only Son is friggin' awesome. Like a modern Thunder Road. Cool Religious imagery, strong lyrics, Bruce says the hill where Jesus was crucified was his \"Darkness on the Edge of Town\". I hope the rumours about falsetto and organ on the album are wrong because his solo piano rendtion was phenominal. This is going to be THE SONG off of this album. I don't need to hear this one screwed over by Falsetto, we can only hope it doesn't fall prey to \"Real Word\" disease (see: Christic Shows). I almost started to cry the second time he played JWAOS (as it will now be known). 6th song was \u2014 argh \u2014 Waiting on a Sunny Day. Not the best rendition or song choice but the singalong was fun. 7th was what seemed like 9 takes of the Rising. I didn't mind. Finally was the 8th song, the obvious choice for a closer, Thunder Road. Solo Piano, no harmonica. Odd not to here any harmonica in there. Bruce does well describing the song as an \"Invitation to his music\", that's where it all stemmed from, this \"Invitation\". After the explanation he was gone, but came back for a very short Q &amp; A. Not too many people got to ask questions, I didn't. Bruce seemed a bit stand-offish (can't blame him after Sommerville). Then he was gone on the wind. We clapped and pounded and shook that little stadium for an encore, but didn't get one. Oh well, can't blame the man, he was probably pooped. With the concert over, me and the guy sitting next to me went for Subs at a Wawa Food Market. Order on computer, intriguing. I go back to the room and crash. Got up at 7am this morning and got on the scary train to Asbury Park. Figured I should treat myself to something extra while I was here. Even bigger mistake. You Jersey Boys and Girls must be used to it but where that train dropped me off was not cool. There were some seedy folk around that area. Needless to say I hightailed it out of AP and went back to Long Branch where I got on the train to Newark Airport. Half a day later, I'm back here writing to all of you. I want everyone to know what an amazing experience I had. I wouldn't trade it for the world, regardless of the fears or expenses. I would do anything to hear the man play. I would cross the netherworld, I would swim oceans, well\u2026.you get the picture. I'm slowly fading now, time to get some sleep.

He was at times very serious and reflective; jovial and energetic; and brilliantly witty and sharp. Everyone in the intimate theatre was celebrating the moments shared with an incredible musicmaker/songwriter or songwriter/musicmaker?! Bruce referred to this proposition as which came first - the chicken or the egg? It was also fabulous to hear encores of Nebraska, Waitin' On A Sunny Day and Thunder Road. He played 2 great new songs from Devils and Dust. My sister Stacy and I would like to thank MaryAnn R.'s daughter for allowing us to participate in this great night.

I for one appreciate this new approach because stripped of the band, it really allows for the beauty, imagery, power and poetry of Bruce's lyrics to come to the forefront. The piano versions of For You and Tougher emphasizes the true romanticism that has accounted for so much of Bruce's work. Great version of Lost in the Flood \u2014 powerful images had such an impact just coming from Bruce and the piano. Great show \u2014 should be an awesome tour. Check it out. The new material sounds great live. And of course, no better place to see Bruce than in Asbury. He should just play 20 nights in Asbury and put out a cd of the best of those nights.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Jesus was an Only Son is a beautiful piece of work. Maria' Bed and Long Time work well live. I really love the piano work.

He opened with a great version of Reason to Believe, then went into Devils and Dust, Youngstown, and Lonesome Day. I liked a lot of the songs from the new album, especially Jesus was an only son, the hitter, matamoras banks, long time comin, and maria's bed. The highlight for me was bruce playing for you on the piano. That was the first time I heard the song in concert. It was also great to see him play real world, highway patrolman, part man/part monkey, further on up the road, the rising, and waiting on a sunny day. All in all, a solid opening for the devils and dust tour.

Bruce opened the show to a standing ovation from the sold out and beautifully lit Fox Theatre, playing harmonica, crouched over, he launched into a chilling rendition of \"Reason to Believe\", footstomps and all. Bruce was very entertaining in his story telling throughout the night and was at ease the entire show asking the audience at the start of the show to \"<em>Turn off the cell phones, and please don't clap along as my sense of rhythym isn't too good</em>.\" Incredible versions of \"For You\" and \"Racing in the streets\" reinforced his mastery not only on guitar but showcased his skills on the piano. Many of the new songs were brilliantly performed among great new versions of lesser known Bruce classics, such as \"Youngstown\", &amp; \"Highway Patrolman\". New songs \"Black Cowboys\", \"Devils &amp; Dust\",\"Jesus Was An Only Son\" and especially \"Long Time Comin' were enough to know the new album is destined to become a Bruce classic. \"The Rising\" was also a highlight that showcased the strength of this great song even without the help of the E Streeters. The closing song was a stirring and emotionally charged version of \"Promise Land\" that pulled together his spiritual themes and family values he spoke of and sang about throughout the night. Stripping his songs down to bare bones shows why Bruce's songwriting and melodies are second to no one. It will be a treat to see Bruce hit the road with the E Street Band after performing these songs on this acoustic tour and to see the evolution of the great new songs from \"Devil's &amp; Dust\". Bruce seems to get better as the years go on. Thanks Bruce for the opportunity to experience your artistry in such a great and intimate venue such as The Fox Theatre. It was an experience I will not soon forget.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Scott DeMand</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">\"Reason To Believe\" was indeed an amazing new twist\u2026 Bruce is truly the best Harmonica player in the World. \"For You\" was amazing\u2026\u2026 didn't care for the \"Promised Land\" at the end, the original is far better, and he should have ended the show with a classic. The New Album will be remembered no better than Nebraska, or Tom Joad, but will continue to show the amazing talent of Bruce, and the chances in creativity he takes.

Even though this show was at an arena, the upper levels were curtained off and the stage was pushed more forward than a normal concert stage to make the setting more intimate. I was seated in the 8th row center, so I got a great view. Even though I was literally touching the stage at a phoenix show during a rising tour and even touched the boss 3 times during that night, I felt closer to the music and his presence this time. Bruce came out to a standing ovation and asked the crowd for some silence or he'd have to \"get out my chainsaw.\" The 5,000 plus people in attendance at the show listened, and the audience was dead silent throughout the show during songs. Here were some of the highlights for me at the show: the 12-string version of \"youngstown,\" \"the Rising,\" \"matamorous banks\"\u2026 actually, all the songs were amazing. The sound was crystal clear at the arena, which is unusual. During a few songs, Bruce counted '1,2,3' and then kicked into a harmonica jam. During \"maria's bed,\" Bruce even said 'c'mon boys', to signal where the rest of the band comes in on the album. When he said these things, you remembered that, 'oh yeah, he's usually with the e street band.' He was so amazing by himself, that I forgot that he's usually with a full band, playing much more upbeat songs. Nils joined the band during the first encore song, 'this hard land'.

Mis-steps: the opening \"Reason to Believe\" was incomprehensible and just did not work. \"My Best Was Never Good Enough\" and \"Highway Patrolman\"? There are much better songs on Nebraska that could have been substituted for these two or, heaven forbid, we should get \"Incident\" in Phoenix. But I'm not really complaining, the concert was awesome, I'm still thinking about it 9 days later. One final word about the final song, the re-working of \"The Promised Land.\" This is a song that everyone knows and loves, yet not a single person (at least around me) was singing along, or even trying to sing along. Everyone was just mesmerized watching Bruce's soulful, powerful performance. What a way to end it.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Well, here he goes again. Bruce with a guitar, or piano, or harmonica, and a story to tell\u2026there just isn't a better ticket than that. Tonight he weaved a theme of love throughout the playlist, laughing about how much his mom loved all those old songs on the radio when he was growing up, and how his dad warned him that love songs were part of a government conspiricy. He sang his own versions of love songs (Incident on 57th Street/If I Should Fall Behind) as well as the results of a love that didn't last (Reno). I remember marveling at how one man could captivate such a throng of people back when stadium shows were sold out and 100,000 people, myself included, acted as one, thrusting our fists in the air to punctuate the songs. Now, it's the quiet reflection going on in each of our heads as we listen to the new songs from \"Devils and Dust\" that is marvelous. My twin boys just turned one year old recently and this was the first real night out for my wife and me since they were born.

I was expecting an upgraded version of the Tom Joad Tour (which I liked), even after reading all the glowing reviews from what Bruce last night aptly labelled as \"the converted.\" This was really an entirley different deal. The debate goes on among some as to which Bruce is best, the \"live rocker\" or the \"solo act\". I prefer a mixture, but, I must say this\u2026 if you want to get the ultimate \"cosmic Bruce\" you got some of it in Chicage last night in a way I have never seen at the big shows. You just can't describe the incredible moments on paper. You had to be there. How lucky are we fans to have heard \"Incident\" and \"The River\" on solo piano and an incredible \"My Beautiful Reward\" on organ? And in a small theater with great sound no less. Did anyone even think this was possible a few years (decade) ago? Most of us have heard \"Incident\" from the Main Point in '75 but to be in the crowd in '05 for an almost as good and impassioned version? Wow. The great thing about the show, besides the above (which we know is worth the price of admission alone), in my opinion, is that we were not there to see an oldies or a \"greatest hits\" act. I love all those songs as much as the next person, but how many reunion tours do you need? What makes Bruce great first and foremost is his writing, and for many years there just wasn't that much going on? I read an article called \"Born to Run Out of Ideas\" and even being a strong member of the flock, I had to admit there was some truth to it. The Chicago show brought it all back for me. The new songs were fresh, powerful and poignant. They were delivered by a completely relaxed, fresh, alive and funny (finally) Bruce. They all sounded, as we have come to expect, much better than the album cuts. As usual, there were mostly ups (Besides the above mentioned Long Time Comin, Jesus, The Hitter, Fall Behind were all great) and a few downs (Reason to Believe sounded like Tom Waits on a chain gang, which isn't all that bad I guess; Part Man Part Monkey sounded kinda funky but I never got it and still don't; I'm on Fire, I have no need for with or without a Banjo, and Bruce whistles about as well as I do) but that's the point. There was novelty and there was experimentation, which is great for an artist of Bruce's stature. And what stands out the most, I guess, is when did Bruce become such a good piano player, as well as deliver multiple instruments other than guitar beautifully?\"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Lily</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Having been shut out of the TJ tour I wasn't sure what to expect. I was looking forward to the intimacy of the night and hearing from Bruce himself. He doesn't talk much on the stadium tours anymore. Well any expectation or desire was surely granted. It was a very intimate night, in a great theatre with terrific sound. Highlights were certainly Incident right into The River on piano, Leah, Long Time Coming, The Hitter all played well with Leah being the highlight. What surprised me (and shouldn't have) is just how talented Bruce is. It is difficult to carry a show with a band but to be able to play all the instruments he did and use the vocal range that he has attained was truly amazing. The vocals on Incident were richer than I have ever heard before.<br/>\nGet ready Virgina, its going to be great.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Mixing in a little political commentary along the way, the show was not only musically moving but cut to the soul as well. The opener Beautiful Reward (organ and harmonica) was particularly awesome.

I purchased 'Born in the USA' on cassette when it came out, and was familiar with his earlier work. In fact, I really wanted to see the 'Born in the USA' tour, but I was 9, and I didn't exactly have a way to get there. Not to mention, my 25 cent weekly allowance at the time wouldn't pay the price of admission. So, like any other kid with A.D.D., I turned my attention elsewhere. Specifically heavy metal, where I lived out the remainder of the 80's wearing nothing but KISS, Anthrax, and Guns N' Roses gear. As the years passed by, I remained familiar with Bruce's work, but didn't really appreciate it. Especially the 'Made for Hollywood' material like, 'Streets of Philadelphia,' and 'Secret Garden.' When summer 03' hit, I decided to get tickets to the 'E Street Band' show in Pittsburgh as a gift for my wife. I went in with no expectation, and left absolutely floored. I have been to hundreds of live shows, and in 3 hours and 15 minutes, Springsteen instantly became the best one. The energy and excitement exchanged between the audience and 'The Boss' was unlike anything I've ever seen. I probably only knew half of the songs, but each one was powerful. After that, I frantically gathered Springsteen's back catalogue, and vowed never to miss another tour. Bruce is now on the road playing a scaled down solo set in promotion of his new disc, 'Devils &amp; Dust.' I have never seen him without the 'E Street Band,' so I didn't know what to expect from this outing. Once again, I was not disappointed. When I arrived, I was handed a pamphlet outlining the 'house rules.' Alcohol would not be served after the start of the show, and you were only permitted to enter and leave the hall in between songs. Now, I enjoy the 'hops and barley' as much as the next guy, but you'd think common sense would tell you to cut back on the alcohol intake under these circumstances. Nope, not Cleveland. People were slamming as many beers as they possibly could before the show started, and then saving up beers to drink during the show. As a result, people were filing in and out of the bathroom like fire ants between songs. I feared this would be a distraction, but it wasn't. I was too focused on the performance. The show itself was a memorizing mixture of vocals, guitars, pianos, and atmosphere. The presentation was so intense, it seemed like I was the only person in the building. That is until I looked around and saw people so affected by the music, tears were streaming down their faces. Especially during songs like, 'Devils &amp; Dust,' 'Wreck on the Highway,' and 'Stolen Car.'<br/>\nSpringsteen played for approximately 2 hours and 20 minutes, and again proved why he is one of the best in the business. Comparing this show to an 'E Street Band' show is like comparing apples and gourds. But the intensity and sincerity of the performance was once again unmatched, and incomprehensible to anyone who hasn't experienced it first hand. Whether you're a die hard 'Boss' fan, or a total stranger to the music, a Springsteen show is a living work of art not to be missed. While this tour dropped the 'E Street Band,' and the standard rock anthems, it more than made up for it in delivery and atmosphere. Once again, Bruce Springsteen shattered expectations and further qualified his legendary status in music history.<br/>\nPS: You can check this review and a review of \"Devils &amp; Dust\" in the music section of \"411mania.com\" Thanks!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Michael Collins</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Cleveland was my 57th Bruce show and I can now easily place it in my top 5. I had a small sign for \"Incident\" but decided to honor the code of the evening and not put it on display. So I get it anyway and ended my streak of bad luck of never hearing it in person. Couple that with \"Racin\" and then throw in the ultra rare \"Stolen Car\", what more can anyone ask of the man? \"Reason to Believe\" and \"Dream, Baby Dream just blew me away.

No chance of that, World Premiere, The Iceman on piano followed by another haunting performance of Incident. Those two songs would have made this the best stop thus far on the tour but a few songs later he returns to the piano and breaks into one of the most underrated songs on the River, Wreck on the Highway.

Touring with the band is always a special event, but this solo approach really provides for some reflective moments as Bruce's lyrics come to thye forefront when he's playing guitar or piano. Highlights: Beautiful Reward, absolutely love the bluesy, Muddy Waters, Howlinwolf Reason to Believe, Incident on piano is simply breathtaking and beautiful. The imagery throughout Black Cowboys is both heartbreaking and optimistic. Maria's Bed, Part Man/Monkey and Further are equally great moments. I know fans are used to the fist-pumping rock events Bruce and Band usually perform, but this tour, a chance to really listen to the lyrics and Bruce speak about his music is a rare treat not to be missed.

Unfortunately, there are people out there who would cheer if Bruce farted his way through Born to Run and that blind loyalty just strokes his ego.

I was in section 236 and experienced the TOTAL loss of sound that occured for 2 entire songs and part of a third. Someone should have noticed and informed Bruce. There was NO heckling, just frustrated requests to \"Fix the sound.\" Someone in the Crew should be fired, at the very least.

I was impressed with Bruce's ability to manage to sustain an appreciative silence throughout the crowd as he worked his way through Reno, Nebraska, The Hitter, Matamoras and Promised Land. Especially during Promised Land, you literally could have heard a pin drop. Highlights: Real World is just amazing on the piano, romantic as Fall Behind. Love the distorted, bluesy Reason to Believe. That one alone sets the tone for most of Bruce's songs anyway, dealing with that spiritual ambiguity, that no matter how good or bad the situation, or the intent of the main character, whether the goals are physical, spiritual or emotional, nothing comes to any of us in a simple, straightforward way, there's always going to be a slight grey area. That's life and Bruce certainly makes that evident throughout his music. Black Cowboys, Leah, Long Time, Part Man, Jesus and The Hitter all sound great live. Love the reworking of Ramrod, turning it into a little country-polka swing. Great show. Hope to see Bruce come around in the fall and do a few more solo shows. Hope he switches up the set a bit and it would be nice to hear Incident more often. Also, Mr. Springsteen, how about a piano version of Price you Pay or Drive all Night? \"There's magic in the night.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>Section312</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">First off, the show was very good, the spin on his old tunes that were morphed to fit the acoustic format was very interesting and added new life and a whole new perspective on the songs we have heard 100's of times. Unfortunately his \"artist\" mentality came through in an ugly way. About a 1/4 of the way through the show a segment of the sound system went dead. You could hardly hear the song being played, never mind understand the lyrics. As this continued, he continue to play and several people in the effected area of the arena started yelling that they could not hear. At that point Bruce became extremely agitated and berated the section to \"shut the F**K up\" (direct quote) or leave. Actually any noise or interaction from the crowd was frowned upon with a few exceptions. People paid for their tickets, they should be able to hear what they paid for.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>Jersey Teacher</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">A decent and solid show throughout. Bookending the show with My Beautiful Reward and Dream helps to resonnate that overall optimistic attitude Bruce's music, and shows, have always left his fans with. Devils and Dust material, live, really brings to the forefront the poetic imagery that is throughout his music. Black Cowboys, Long Time, Leah, Jesus and The Hitter are all powerful in their own way. I especially love Black Cowboys and Jesus. The poetic imagery paints a picture that resonnates long after the song has been sung. And like his inspiration, Mr. Guthrie and Mr. Dylan, Bruce is quite successful. Part Man/Monkey works well with that Venture's guitar-sound-eerie. Nice job with The River and The Wish. The acoustic Promised Land is unbelievable. In it's own way, it is just as powerful as the full band version because it's a one man's promise to himself, a quiet, yet purpose-driven determination to keep on believing. Hey, what else can we do? What made this show more special than others, for me, was the fact that my own poetic muse was with me, Angela. She has inspired me, as has Bruce. As we sat next to each other, listening to Real World and singing snippets to one another, the moment affirmed the belief that personal journies of the heart, no matter how difficult, do have their reward. Just have to believe. Real World, the moment,the song, the words, listening to Bruce belt out a heartfelt rendition on the piano, being with Angela, made all those romantic notions and hope for what the future will bring, seem as tangible as holding Ang's hand and kissing her sweet, sweet lips. Thanks Bruce and Ang, for a moment that will never be forgotten. After nearly 115 shows, that one moment ranks amongst one of the absolute best. How could it not? A night of Bruce, his words and music and sharing it all with the girl I love. \"Darling, I'll wait for you, should I fall behind, wait for me\". She moves through poetry with a rhythm and romance all her own.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Wasting no time, he jumped straight into a pump organ version of \"My Beautiful Reward\", a regular opener on this tour. I had been worried before the performance that there might be a lack of atmosphere in the show because of Bruce's strict no noise or clapping policy, which he had asked for at previous shows. But Bruce was noticeably relaxed and the crowd cheered and applauded at every song. Bruce was in fine story-telling form where he delighted the crowd with tales of parenting and life in America. The highlights of the night were \"Racing In The Street\" and \"The River\" where Bruce showcased his abilities masterfully on the piano.

It had the gutsy emotion of the stadium shows with the band yet the venue lent itself to offering a more intimate feel where conversation was almost as important as the music. I felt really privileged to be there - to hear Bruce talk about his music,his children, politics \u2026 He came on stage a little after 8 - which suited many fans well as the traffic in London was horrendous. He strolled on stage dressed in jeans, shirt and jacket and started to play My Beautiful Reward. I was lost by then\u2026 from song to song - some from the new album and many old favourites - played acoustically they sounded fresh and different. An all time favourite of mine, Tougher than the Rest, seemed especially meaningful and raw with emotion. I loved Bruce being on stage alone - moving from guitar to guitar to piano - what a talented guy! His voice was as true and as strong as ever and it looked as though he was enjoying the evening too. I appreciated the explanations behind the writing of the songs. His recordings are always great but live performances are the best. This one did not disappoint - Bruce always exceeds all expectations and it is not a surprise his fans are so loyal. The new songs, more folksy and reminescent of the Tom Joad days, delighted the crowd - I especially liked Matamoros Banks. Yet there were songs from The Rising - and classics such as The Promised Land and Nebraska. At the end of the concert Bruce, as he does, thanked his fans for their support. He told us he'd been coming to London for 30 years. He travelled the edge of the stage and those fortunate enough to be near the front were able to shake his hand (and thank him for the music) and some even managed to give him a kiss! (Another throw back to the early rock days!) He eventually left the stage around 10.30pm. Yes, he's still sexy, and he sounds better than ever.

Maybe it's got something to do with his first Belgian concert ever, in 81, in the same Forrest National-venue, where he amazed us for the first time\u2026 State Trooper was a tour premiere, and was very, very intense. Nebraska: always seemed like a 'cold' song to me, about cold things and people\u2026 Now it turned out to be very warm. Racing: keeps amazing me, this song is - how old? And it's still there, still magic. Jesus Was an Only Son: in between the verses, he described how he was a child once, and has become a daddy now. How hard is can be to raise children. Laughter from the audience with his jokes. Ramrod: funny how the same shaker from his stadium tours is still shaking - in a completely different way. Nice - the audiance on its feet, clapping now - but a bit strange to me. I thought he ought to either continue with 2 or 3 shakers, or not bring any at all. But then again: never complain about his set list! Dream Baby Dream: as in all of his tours, he brings a song that's not his. This man has written so many classics, he has such an enormous arsenal of songs he can choose from - and then he ends with a song nobody knows. You have to have heard it before you understand why: this is pure magic, people drove home in a trance, this is so\u2026 amazing. This was my 26th show - seen two Tom Joads nine years ago. It gets a spot in my top five. He's proven, again, he is a league of its own: there's only a few artists who can entertain a crowd of 50,000 and come back 2 years later, alone, and do this to 7,000 people.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

It was great to see him playing the piano with fantastic versions of The River, Real World or Racing in the Street. The Nebraska part of the set was incredible, with outstanding renditions of State Trooper and Nebraska, along with the \"old-bluesy\" version of Reason to Believe. The acoustic was perfect through the whole show and the atmosphere incredible (though too many flashes from the audience). There was also time for some party with Ramrod at the end, which worked very good with the front of the stage crowded with running fans.

The setlist was predicable in part\u2026 My Beautiful Reward was a fine opener on the pump organ but the shock came soon after \u2026 An EXTREME rendition of Reason To believe for harp and foot-stompin'! I saw people's faces astonished! a great For You at piano\u2026 remains a unique gem but I already hear that in the same venue in 2002 and I would had liked Incident On 57th in the same spot but how could anyone be disappointed to hear a Greetings song?

The songs from D&amp;D recieved a very good response from the crowd\u2026even some clapping on the guitar riffs of Maria's Bed and Leah\u2026 new tunes that are already classic. The Rising works very well in this solo rendition and Bruce gave us a really fine vocal troughout the entire concert\u2026 the solo Further Up was not so great to me, it needs more dynamic work.. a little too much noisy , 12string guitar covered the vocals\u2026Jesus Was An Only Son is another new classic\u2026 with spoken verses between the song verses\u2026 I would had liked to understand more than something\u2026 The show feautured some pre-recorded keyboard parts like Highway 29 and Galveston Bay on the previus solo tour.. I hear them on Silver Pal, Reno and Matamoros Banks\u2026 I wonder how it they works because Bruce dont wear ear monitors, so I think he follows a led click. All in all a great show in a too much large venue\u2026 italian promoters are guilty\u2026. 100 euros for a 1st row-100 euros for the 55 row! I called it speculation.

Being able to just walk to the concert hall was a nice experience. The concert started half an hour late. Probably because people kept running around. Why they did not close the doors earlier is beyond me. The audience was in a rather silent mood which was probably due to the fact that there were so many warnings about being quiet and stuff. But all this changed when Bruce came onstage. He looked terrific, did his usual introduction in German and thenwent straight to business. Much has been said befor about the songs. Nevertheless, here are my 2 cents. Surprisingly, the new songs were the best one (in my opinion). While it was nice that Bruce played songs from all his albums except BTR and Greetings, many versions were a bit too fractured and distorted for my taste. Among the weaker moments were \"Beautiful Reward\", \"I wish I were blind\" and \"The Rising\". The rest was good to excellent. Bruce commanded th stage and his playing and singing were amazing. \"Reason to believe\" with his stomping and singing and playing harmonica through a distortion mike was really cool. My personal highlights were \"Incident\", \"Jesus was an only son\" with Bruce interrupting the song after each verse to explain a bit and share his thoughts about family and live. \"Dream\" was phenomenal. It just went on and on and conveyed Bruce's message and all he is about: open your heart, I want to see you smile, dream, baby, dream. So, all in all it was excellent but I am definetly looking forward to the next concert with the guys from E-Street. But, if you have not seen him solo, I advise you to go \u2026 it is really worth it.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Kai</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">The first German concert beginning with \"beautiful reward\"\u2026 this change was an indication of a what's gonna happen in this great show! Bruce was in a very good mood, even a little bit better than in Munich or Frankfurt, I guess. He changed about the half of the setlist from the day before, the audience was very quiet during the songs and very enthusiastic between them. \"this hard land\" (the whole crowd sang \"stay hard, stay hungry, stay alive\"), \"tougher than the rest\", \"bobby jean\" - some of the highlights of the concert. \"I'm on fire\" came up in an countryish style with bruce playing banjo and starting with whistle. He was very happy with the audience and mentioned it several times at the end of the show (\"You have been a great, great audience, you give me all that large quiet space and I appreciate that very much\u2026\"). I would say, the best of the three German shows: great Bruce, great audience, great setlist\u2026 I'm greatly looking forward to the Hamburg and Berlin shows!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

One highlight after the other.

Except for one moron who shouted \"higher\" the first time he did it, you could hear a needle drop during these \"stunts\". All in all the audience was great, except for the never ending run for the toilet for those who had to buy the \"emergency\" package from the bar before the concert - 5 pints of beer for the price of 4.

He sang \"Pony boy, pony boy\" as a joke at the beginning of the song. Afterward he laughingly said that it would have been more accurate, from his son's point of view, to have sung that he wasn't going to \"fuck it up too bad this time,\" rather than the actual lyric. I'm sure the version of Reason to Believe was lost on a large portion of the crowd. My wife didn't know what it was unitl I told her, and she knows the Nebraska version well. I liked the way Bruce backed off a bit from the microphone for part of This Hard Land. It really made the crowd hush and listen to the low-volume vocal. At one point someone yelled out that \"You're the Boss!\" or \"Who's the Boss?\" and Bruce laughed and said, \"Thanks for informing me. Now that that's settled, let's keep on.\" Before Matamoras Banks, Bruce said we needed a human immigration policy rather than vigilantes on the U.S.-Mexican border.

Fascinating twist on several old songs. The new rendition of Reason to Believe was a throwback to Robert Johnson/Muddy Waters-replete with the pounding refrain and static mike. Hopefully this will be released someday, or at least available as a bootleg. Promised Land was reworked and Ramrod was played with a Mexicali beat. Loved Bruce's story about his father, who is a very interesting presence in his music- and is very much like many men of that post WWII generation who grew up with a cynisicm toward the world that clashed with idealism of their Baby Boomer offspring. Coming from the same type of background as Bruce I saw that cynisicm in my father and uncles all of whom would concur with Douglas Springsteen that Love songs were a government plot to get you married and make babies to feed the machine.. You know,in retrospect, they were right. Into the Fire, Spare Parts among others were rivetting. Only weak song(to me) was the last one Dream - which left many scratching their heads - although there were many who seemed mesmerized. I'm with Douglas Springsteen on this one.. Dream was a plot sending us subliminal messages to buy T-shirts and crap at the concession stands. I know that it got me to buy t-shirts for my wife and kids, which I had no intention of doing prior to the start of the song.

Overall, I'd say the best of four I've seen on D&amp;D so far.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>The Big Mook</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Fantastic show! Bruce got a little testy with interuptions, but he's that way at the e-street band concerts. Venue was surprisingly good! The best sound quality of any Bruce show I've seen in a while. Certainly better than Continental Arena. Bruce also apologized for an incident which occurrred at the CA when the sound system failed. Highlights: The Promise, Into The Fire, Spare Parts, Matamoras Banks, Racing in the Street with Intro, Jesus was an only son and intro. Weak spots: No real weakspots. Dream was not well like in my section.

We lost a lot of brothers that day going up those stairs and into the fire. Bruce is the only one who truly has catured and appreciated the bravery of those who went into the fire. The rest of the show was fantastic, and I'm waiting for the full band tour!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Tom Cantillon</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Great show.

Other highlights: All that Heaven, Racing and Lost on piano. Bruce should toss in a piano song for the encores. Be nice to hear Price you Pay a few times on the tour or even Human Touch. Solid show from start to finish. Bruce was very relaxed and chatty with the crowd. Perfect sound.

Either that or I am correlating closeness to the stage to impact of the artist. It seemed more intimate in the 19th row and Bruce appeared to interact more with crowd. Glad my friends finally got a taste of Maria's Bed. Can't understand why it is not an automatic on this tour. Must be a stress on his voice, but tonight was great. A very strong encore, glad to see Land of Hopes and Dreams back in the spotlight. My section was awestruck by the whole performance, hanging right to the end.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

The reworking of The Promised Land was incredible. Just as in the past, the new songs came alive for me with great performances from the stage.

From the first notes of 'If I should Fall Behind' it was obvious that we would get a show to remember. Thanks to my friend George, I had a great seat and from where I sat, the sound was great, the stage set was beautiful and the performance was moving. 'Reason to Believe' with it's harmonica and foot-stomp accompaniment sounded like some long lost Howling Wolf 78. This was my first solo / acoustic Bruce show and I was a little unsure of how it would compare to a show with the whole band. I love the E Street Band as much as anybody but I've come to the conclusion that E Street shows are about entertainment with moments of art. This solo show was about Bruce the artist who happens to be entertaining. Bruce the artist can take a little noticed song like 'Valentine's Day', reset it on the piano, and make it one of the highlights of the evening. Yes, I know it was only the second time he'd done it in concert, but that wasn't what made it great. It was the heart that he put into it. I've always loved the song but this was like hearing it for the first time. Other highlights were 'Jesus Was an Only Son' and 'Wild Billy's Circus Story' and 'Galveston Bay'.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>N.C.

Bruce was much looser. Much like Tom Joad tour, the rules weren\u2019t mentioned in Pittsburgh. Don't know if he stopped doing it, but it made for a racous show. We got the only song from Tom Joad early, Youngstown. This was a loud song. I feel lucky to get this one again. First highlight for me was Long Time Coming. He left it out of Cleveland. I love where he stepped off mike to deliver/sing/talk the lines about his dad and later mistakes. Powerful. Bruce added that he meant for the last word to be \"fuck it up as badly but it didn't rhyme.\" Don't know if he always does it, but I loved it. One Step Up was just brilliant. His voice has changed so that it sounds more like he means it since the tol tour. Bruce sent it out to \"Kenny, thanks for the card.\" I later found out that Kenny Chesney had covered the song on one of his discs. To correct Backstreets he said. \"I should play that one more often\" when he was rewarded with a loud standing O afterwards. He dedicated a great For You to Johnny Grushecky. It was a much different feel than the guitar version from flood aid recently. I thought his piano playing made the song. All I'm Thinkning Bout was dedicated to Dezi Grushecky. You can tell he has kids, what you do for one you do for the other. The song was fast and really lifted an already high mood. When the e-bay electric piano appeared Bruce said, \"Let's give the people a happy song, I think I've got one or two of those.\" With that he went into All that Heaven Will Allow. As a big fan of the Tunnel cd this was a thrill. I noticed Bruce laughing during the song. Afterward he ezplained that his&gt; mike was dropping and he thought he'd have to sing on the floor. Darkness was the song I was hoping for the most. I beleive this is the definative version. Loved it at Joad. Real World was very powerful. I never got such a hit off that song before. Great to go and see friends from many places. I met up with my friends from Spain at the stage rush. Imagine. During Waiting, Bruce said, \"I'm waiting for you to sing the fuck along.\" I noticed him point at something at the end of the song. With that he wentinto a loose Growing Up and said, \"for the guy with the sign.\" Hearty reception for my personal hero, Joe Grushecky. They did a spirited version of Homestead trading verses and guitar licks. I liked it better than the acoustic version they did together on Joad tour as there was more Bruce. Dream Baby Dream closed the show greatly. I disagree with the local paper's review that the show was dark. This ends the show on an up note \"We gotta keep the fire going, I just want to see you smile, so dream baby dream.\" In the crowd, Kenny Chesney, Renee Zellweger, Keith Urban, most of the Houserockers, Andy Sheehan, Paul Steigerwald, and rumors of many more. The will call was a disaster. Ditto the food and beer. They ran out of beer before I got mine and then the food stand closed. Great show. And the roof didn't leak.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I always kinda wondered that and this one really came out of left field tonight, and it was beautiful. I've never gotten to see a world premire and here it was. I thought it sounded better tonight than what it does on the \"Essential\" too. I don't know, maybe I'm just biased to it. \"Reason to believe\" was haunting. While we're on the subject, so was \"State Trooper\", \"Lost in the Flood\", \"The Hitter\", and \"The Promised Land.\" You know your're watching a talent when he can play something so beautifully haunting and then wonderful acoustic crowd pleasers such as \"Cynthia\", (Which is really great acouticly) \"The Rising\", \"Lonesome Day\", \"Valentines Day\", \"Ramrod\", and \"Bobby Jean.\" His stories were hilarious and he was as loose as I've ever seen him before, and that's pretty good. The stuff from the new album, \"Devils 'n Dust\", \"Long Time Comin'\", \"Reno\", \"Jesus was an Only Son\", \"Matomoros Banks\", and \"The Hitter\" were perfect, with some pretty good stories along with them. Lots from \"Tunnel\" tonight. \"One Step Up\", \"When You're Alone\", \"Valentines Day\". \"Back in your Arms\" was a tour premire along with \"Cynthia.\" \"For You\" was excellent. \"Two Hearts\" fit in nicely as well. He added at the end of it the lyrics should have read: Two hearts are better than one Two hearts- easier said than done Like I said, he seemed to be in a darn good mood tonight. In closing, everyone was impressed with \"Dream, Baby, Dream.\" The crowd left feeling like they got their money's worth. I talked to a couple who commented they'd never seen him that loose. It didn't really bother people the band wasn't there.

Some funny moments included Bruce messing up the line in Long Time Coming - \"It's me and you, Rosie, cross\u2026 cracklin' like crossed wires\u2026\". Bruce had a huge grin when he and the crowd realized the goof. Then he changed the next part to \"I hope I'm not gonna f*ck it up this time\". After the song he said that he wished he had recorded it that way, to give himself a little wiggle room. He seemed to be off his game just a bit later too - when he played Cynthia, he sang \"Cynthia\u2026.\" and then paused and then restarted it. It looked like he had forgotten the words. Then, during Bobby Jean there was a spot where the same thing happened. Oh, and there was a sound glitch before \"I Wish I Were Blind\", and he made a joke about sound engineers having groupies too, and that someone wasn't minding the store. All in all, it was a fun show and nobody seemed to mind the glitches - most thought they were fun.

It was funny to see bruce mess up the end of long time comin', he also played sherry darling, one step up, it's so hard to be a saint in the city, cynthia, I wish I were blind. I liked the rip on kansas before playing part man, part monkey. The highlights of the night were ain't got you, an incredible version of the rising, the promised land, and dream baby dream.

The Fox theater was sold out, all 4,000 seats filled. Easily the most ornate theater I had ever been in, just a beautiful setting, every square inch decorated. I was maybe 15 feet from the microphone, prime seating to be sure. The stage was framed in plush red velvet drapes, 2 chandeliers overhead. Dressed in blue jeans, a black shirt rolled up above his elbows and boots, Bruce looked fit and happy. Despite the grind of being on the road for months at a time, it appeared that performing live agreed with him. He sat at the keyboard and opened with a rarity 'Back in Your Arms', then took out his harmonica and played 'Reason to Believe' in a funky, smoky delta blues style, keeping time with his boot pounding the stage. As he finished that, he strapped on his acoustic guitar and went right into 'Devils and Dust', the title track from his latest release. It was about this time that I felt the sides of my face hurting, and I realized it was from grinning non-stop! Bruce continued to entertain us for the next two and a half hours, featuring songs from his new album and a mix of some of his older classics. He played piano, electric piano, harmonica, acoustic 6 and 12 string guitars and for a memorable performance of 'Part Man, Part Monkey' plugged in an electric guitar. He was in a good mood, chatting with the crowd, sharing stories of his growing up, being raised Catholic, the trials and tribulations of being a parent of a teenager. Early on he played 'County Fair', a perfect song for late summer. However, he botched one of the lines, stopped, went back to play it again and messed it up again. He laughed and said \"Okay, how about I just skip that line\"! He played 'The River' on piano, then brought the house to its feet with a standing ovation for the first ever solo performance of 'Backstreets'! As the crowd stood and cheered at the conclusion, Bruce stood up from the piano, put on his guitar, strode to the microphone while a floor level flood light came on behind him, framing him in the brightness. He then sang the opening lines \"Can't see nothin' in front of me, can't see nothin' comin up behind\" from 'The Rising'. Lots of emotion in that song, played superbly. The whole night was like that, just one amazing song after another with nary a break. He finished up, waved to the crowd and walked offstage to deafening applause and cheers. A few minutes later he walked back out for a 5 song encore while the entire crowd stood. One of the songs was the classic 'The Promised Land', but played in an entirely different style. Bruce strummed the chords, then used his thumb and fingers to keep a percussive beat going against the body of the acoustic guitar, hard to describe but done in a great way. He finished off the night with a cover of the song 'Dream Baby Dream', played on pump organ. He got the organ to play on a loop, stood up and walked to the front of the stage and sang while the organ played behind him. Holding a microphone in one hand, waving the other hand back and forth in a mesmerizing rhythm, he swayed back and forth as he sang. He finished the song and walked offstage as the organ continued to play, a very satisfying finish. When the house lights came up and the fans gave one final round of thunderous applause before heading out, I thought the night could not have been any better. We stood and talked while waiting for the crowd to thin out, the aisles were jammed. I turned and looked back into the wings of the stage and saw Bruce standing by himself, arms folded. I waved at him and he waved back, the perfect ending to a perfect night!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I saw Bruce Springsteen for the first time in February of 1977 at age 23. I've been a fan ever since. The show in Milwaukee this past weekend was the tenth show I've seen and the third in Milwaukee in the past 2 years. He played The Rising shows there in 2003 and 2004. In fact, in the 2003 show the band played 'Little Queenie' as a final encore for the Milwaukee crowd. I think that The Boss enjoys Milwaukee and the city seems to bring out his best. The show at The Bradley Center on Sunday night was exceptional. I sat around several people who had seen 4 or 5 shows on this tour and they all were ectastic about the set list and some of the unique songs he pulled out for this show. There was a smattering of everything in this show so everybody knew at least some of the material. I thought that all of it was played beautifully and that his arrangements were all initimate and recognizable (maybe with the exception of 'Reason to Believe'. I saw bob Marley 2 years before he died and the thing that struck me about Marley also strikes me about Springsteen. His voice cuts through everything. His voice brings you in and keeps you there and you find yourself being overwhelmed by it. He seemed to be in great humor this night, laughing frequently and although his audience dialog is always practiced, it seemed spontaneous and genuine. I've seen a number of great concerts in my life. My favorite Springsteen show was the from the legendary 'Darkness' tour in 1978, which stands out as one of the 2 or 3 best live shows I've ever seen. Still, this show was memorable, visceral, and ultimately as inimate a baring of an artist's soul as you're ever likely to see. I've truly never experienced anything quite like the closing rendition of 'Promised Land'. Played quietly, the entire theater was silent. There was no noise. Nobody talking, nobody coming in or going out. It was mesmerizing, exhilerating and ethereal. In retrospect, that one song, and the setting it was played in, stand out as perhaps the single best thing I've ever seen in 33 years of seeing live music. It was a transcendent moment in Rock and Roll. One can only hope that it is released next year on DVD, so everyone can see this truly remarkable show. If you haven't gone yet and can see it before it ends, find the time and do it. It may not come around again. Bruce Springsteen stands with only a handful of others - Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan, John Lennon, Mick Jagger - as a Rock and Roll visionary. As he said in self deprecation during the show - 'The man does it all.' Sunday night, Auguest 7, 2005 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, he did just that.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I especially love the River songs, and I wanna Marry You was beautifully done. I hope Bruce is recording this tour and should offer, as many other artists are now doing, copies of the performances on line. As far as songs I think would fit well within the framework of what he is presenting: Drive all Night \u2014 without a doubt, Price You Pay and Streets of Fire all on piano!

I was in my early 20s and I headed with a girlfriend for the show right from Austria. First long-distance flight, first time ever outside of Europe, first time travelling without parents\u2026 We were quite soaked up because of a rainy day and a long travel from JFK to Uniondale by train, by bus and by foot. And than the magic happend: We had tickets way up in the back of the Coliseum but we were happy to made it there. A few minutes before the show started, a guy showed up and asked, if we wanted to switch seats\u2026 we thought it couldn't get worse than sitting way up there in the back and so we followed him. He guided us downstairs, passing every security check without any questions and he led us to the two center seats in the very first row, right in front of the mic. Never have been that lucky again in my life. It was like a personal, intimate concert just for the two of us ;) So the newspaper headline \"Flyin' solo, 1st class\" really sums it up for our experience.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I've never been to a Bruce show with so many \"so what\" moments. I am usually a big proponent of \"non-greatest hits\" shows, and am also a big fan of this tour simply for the quantity of songs from multiple decades, but despite all that, I found the show to be lacking. As always, there were great moments, such as \"Ain't Got You,\" \"Racing,\" \"The New Timer\" (which I never heard before) and a few others, but great moments are not the standard for a Bruce show. That's what's disappointing. That Johnny 99 deal was weird; I wouldn't have even know it was that song if I didn't hear the 99 digit coming out of there a couple times, but it was not nearly as bad as that \"Idiot's World\" as a show opener. Awful. Quite a few of the other songs, especially in the 1st half of the show, I thought were just plain boring, such as \"Reno\" (which I still can't get into), \"All I'm Thinking About\", \"State Trooper\", \"Ties that Bind\". 15 out of the 25 songs were different than those played in Chicago on the first leg. To me that is awesome. On the other hand, and again at least for me, I would have chosen any of a hundred songs to replace half the setlist that was played, and that's just way too many. On top of all that, the usual connection between Bruce and the audience, which is half of the magic in any Bruce show seemed to be missing. Maybe the venue was just way too big for an \"intimate show,\" I, for one, was looking for the band by the middle of the show.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>Keeder99</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">After reading the review from Bronx Kid, I have to say, this show was weak at best. What happened during Johnny 99? Where was the interaction with the crowd? Why was there the huge crowd dead? I know Bruce wants silence for the songs, but the reaction after songs completed was similar to that you would hear after a golfer make a putt for bogie, just a ho-hum applause. I'm just glad Bruce didn't ask me if it was the best I've ever heard, because I would have replied, \"Not even close\".</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Elvis</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Granted this is the 1st and only concert I'll see on this tour, but I thought it was a damn fine show. Other than the completely inaudible Johnny 99 &amp; The Ties That Bind (not one of my favorites), I liked his song selection and performances with excellent versions of Living Proof, Bobby Jean, Tougher Than The Rest, State Trooper, Racing In The Streets, I Wish I Were Blind, etc. I thought the show was great \u2014 especially considering it was supposed to be intimate in the cavernous United Center.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Mentioned his big fan (stalker) Rich, then held up several photos of Rich on mountain tops unfurling a Bruce Springsteen banner, you could see them great on the big screens. He joked alot about being at the Minnasota Vikings Sex party. Played several songs he said had been requested backstage by other stalkers, er fans, Valentines Day, Wild Billy. Bruce said it had been 30 years since he had been to Madison, and he would come back with the entire band next time, someone shouted \"when\", yeah, it was that quiet in this croud of maybe 5000, he answered \"I don't know, if I knew I wouldn't be me\". Of all the shows I've seen in the last 25 years, I'd rate this as one of his best, and a must see. You could have walked in and bought a ticket here last night.

David Delp</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">What a rare treat. To see Bruce twice a few months apart. I saw the show in Milwaukee in August and thought it was fabulous. In some ways, the show in Madison was better. For me, Madison has many memories. I saw many concerts there in the 1972-1976 period when I was in school there. I saw Bruce and the band there in February of 1977, on my 23rd birthday actually, for the first time. It may be the last time he played Madison! To be able to go back, almost 29 years later and see this show was very special. The set list was a real mix of old and new. 4 songs from the first 2 albums were just spectacular. I had not heard Incident on 57th Street in years and I was surprised how much I both remembered and loved the song. Much of the material from Devils and Dust was played in Milwaukee and the rest of this tour and was familiar. There was a little less from Darnkess, than in the Milwaukee show, just Promised Land, at the end. What special treats Highway 29 and Valentines' Day and Land of Hope and Dreams were though. This was such a great set list. I know that there were people in attendance who didn't know much of the material and were somehow disappointed. I heard several people voice that on my way out. I think though that it had to be a treat for people who have listened from the beginning. Bruce seemed to be in great spirits all evening and performed Blinded by the Light as 'penance' for not having been in Madison for so long. He promised to bring the band back the next time. I hope that he holds to it. The only knock I'd have on the show was that the crowd seemed a little out of it to me. The Milwaukee crowd was more into the show. Nonetheless, this is a show that everyone should try to see. It is such a privilege when an artist of this magnitude lets you in this close. You may never see anything quite like it again. And hey, what about the pre-concert music? Bob Dylan doing live stuff, from what sounded like the 70's, that nobody's ever heard before. Even a Spanish version of \"If You See Her, Say Hello\". Very rare stuff I think. Bruce is always tipping his hat to other artists. In this case, the guy that got him started in the first place. What a great show. I still don't understand the foot stomping version of Reason to Believe, but hell, it's growing on me.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>WeReAllGladHere</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">When Nirvana closed their MTV Unplugged show with a cover of Leadbelly's \"In The Pines\" the MTV execs begged them to do an encore. Kurt Cobain refused, saying there was no way he could follow that performance. He was right. If MTV had been on hand to record the Springsteen show in Madison, WI last Saturday it would have probably been the same scene. Springsteen closed the show with a song called \"Dream Baby Dream\". I had never heard the song, so I went online for further information. It turns out nobody has heard the song. It \"may\" be a cover of an old song by a band called Suicide, but nobody is confirming that. It doesn't matter though, I wouldn't have wanted him to play anything but that song to close the show. That is pretty much how the entire show went. If you came expecting to get your \"Born In The USA\" on, tonight was not your night. The show opened with a song Bruce co-wrote for a guy named Joe Grushecky called \"Idiot's Delight\". A fantastic tune made even better by his use of a distorted microphone. It sounded like some Tom Waits action, and man do we love Tom Waits around here. The majority of the setlist relied on lesser known tunes (Valentine's Day, Wild Billy's Circus), songs from the last two albums (Devils and Dust, The Rising) and very few \"classics\" which for the most part didn't show up until the encore (Blinded By The Light, The Promised Land). What would have been one of the more familiar songs, the Nebraska album closer \"Reason To Believe\", was rendered almost unrecognizable on stage. As it was recorded on the album, the song is a bare bones acoustic number with the sort of workingman's understanding tone that Bruce is famous for. On stage tonight, sung through an almost indecipherable bullet microphone, accompanied by nothing but an amplified stomping foot and a repetitive harmonica riff between lines, it took on a whole new feel. No more understanding, no more hope, it sounded like a sales pitch from Satan. \"Believe in me instead\". It was fucking magic. The whole show was magic from beginning to end. If you did show up to hear \"Born In The USA\", I'm pretty sure you still didn't leave disappointed. I don't see how anyone could. Even I didn't recognize a lot of the songs and I couldn't have cared less. It was great music played in a great way. It's hard to be disappointed by that.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Mark Stitt</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">There is an anticipation, a buzz, that builds on the day of a Springsteen concert. I had been holding back a bit, but on Saturday morning Sherri and I left our hotel and did a test run to the Dane County Arena to see how long of a drive it was. As we were driving around the arena, we saw Bruce's tour bus parked out back. Despite my attempts,I could not get Sherri to agree to go up and knock on the door to see if we could come on board and chat with Bruce. This was mainly due to the fact that she asked me what I would even say if I got an audience, to which I had to confess to being tongue-tied\u2026 The cool thing about seeing Bruce several times on one tour is that he never does the same show twice. So it was Saturday night in Madison. Good crowd, I would guess the venue held around 5 or 6,000, pretty full. It is a circular arena, looking up at the ceiling was like looking at the underside of a space ship from 'Close Encounters'! Gotto chat with a couple of women sitting in front of us who had flown in from Portland Oregon for the Chicago show, then decided to go ahead and drive up the road a bit to see the Madison show. I tell ya, these Bruce fans are a crazy lot! A little after 8:00, Bruce strolled out on to the stage without introduction, wearing faded blue jeans and a flannel shirt that brought back memories of the cover of 'Darkness', and started right in on a song I had never heard before, 'Idiot's Delight'. Followed that with Across The Border/Devils &amp; Dust/Empty Sky/Long Time Comin/Highway 29/All That Heaven Will Allow. Up to this point, he had not spoken much to the crowd, just played one song right after another. He then paused briefly to say the next song was a request, sat at the piano and played a beautiful version of 'Incident on 57th Street'. Followed that with a smoky Delta blues version of 'Reason To Believe', then did his falsetto voice for 'All I'm Thinkin About', which required him to sing with his eyes closed and left eyebrow in the up position, quite entertaining. Now that he had the opening portion of the concert behind him, Bruce loosened up and started talking to the crowd. He said that the main question he used to hear was \"what is it like being The Boss?\" to which he used to reply \"Get the f*ck out of here\" but now he goes more for the humble man of the people approach. Laughing as he talked, he said that approach works pretty well and he planned to keep it up for a while and thathe does not lord it over people in public, but prefers to do that in private! He saidthere were many perks that came with being that popular, including getting invited to the White House. \"But not lately\" he added to much laughter, then played 'Ain't Got You' which he wrote to describe that very situation. Followed that up with a rocking version of 'Nebraska', then 'Reno' and a couple of rarities 'Valentine's Day' and 'Lost in the Flood'. Bruce was in top form and the crowd was enthralled with the performance. At one point he stopped to show off some photos that a fan had sent him that showed the fan standing on top of Mount Kilimanjaro while holding up a Bruce sign, and then another shot of the same fan on yet another mountain top holding up another Bruce sign. Bruce commented that these were the types of fans he tended to shy away from, which got a large round of laughs. The final portion of the show kicked off with a stunning version of 'The Rising' where Bruce is backlit with a spotlight, and as he sings a story of 9/11 he is bathed inbright light and becomes a conduit for a power greater than the song itself, very emotional. After thunderous applause, he followed with' Further On (Up the Road)', then he told a story about growing up Catholic, with all of his relatives living on the same block, and how his aunt used to get real scared during thunder storms and would take him into a closet and sprinkle him with Holy Water, to which Bruce made the point that as a 6 year old, that was not all that comforting. He then played 'Jesus Was an Only Son' and once again I thought how cool it would have been for him to record that version forthe album, where he tells a little story between verses about how Jesus did not really want to climb the hill to Calvary but instead daydreamed about managing a bar in Galilee with Mary Magdalene as a bartender, and how they could raise kids and just watch them grow up every day, and the day after that, and the day after that. My description fails to capture how dramatic of a presentation it actually was, but it was quite moving. Iguess my own Catholic upbringing has a lot to do with that. Coming into the home stretch now, an acoustic guitar version of 'Land of Hopes and Dreams\", then sat on a stool and placed an autoharp on his lap and played a song he wrote for a friend 'The New Timer'. It was so cool, Bruce just strummed the harp withhis left hand and played the buttons with his right, well done. Finished off the set with 'Matamoras Banks' and yes, that triggered a stage rush. He barely left the stage, then walked back out and strummed a ukulele (yes, a ukulele!), and played 'Growin Up', which the crowd sang along with word for word. Followed that with 'Wild Billy's CircusStory', then acknowledging a fan in the audience holding up a sign Bruce said, \"Well, if you are gonna go thru the trouble to make a sign I guess I got to sing the song\", picked the opening notes, leaned into the mike and sang \"Madman drummers bummers and Indians in the summer\" from 'Blinded By The Light' from his very first album! How COOL was that? The crowd stood and sang along the entire song, and at the end Bruce threw his head back and sang \"Mama always told me not to look into the sights of the sun, Oh but Mama that's where the fun is\" and I could see the years melt away, it was a youngBruce on stage, the familiar pose of bent knees and a shoulder shrug as he played the guitar, stompin his boots to keep time, grinning from ear to ear. What a treat! He then did 'The Promised Land' but instead of strumming chords on the guitar he just did a style of syncopation of keeping a beat by drumming his fingers and thumb against the body of the guitar while hitting the strings. Hard to describe, but absolutely amazing performance of one of his classics. The crowd had been on its feet for the entire encore, Bruce waved and started to walk off stage but the cheers and whistles rose to such a crescendo that he strolled back to the mike and shouted \"One more\", sat at the pump organ and closed with a beautiful version of 'Dream Baby Dream'. As the organ continued to play, he got up and stood at the front of the stage, single blue spotlight shining down, swaying back and forth while singing \"C'mon dream baby dream, I just wanna see you smile, I just wanna see you smile, c'mon dream baby dream\". Mission accomplished! He finished singing, waved to the crowd and walked off as the pump organ continued to play the final notes, the crowd gave a long and appreciative round of applause. Just a great ending to yet another great performance. So concluded Bruce concert number 9 for me (4 KC, 5 road trips). Sherri and I went out to eat after the show, and were jabbering away at each other, our Bruce buzz was full upon us. I told her, it is just CRAZY to even think about going to see him again some where on this tour, isn't it? Yes, that is just crazy. Hmmmm\u2026</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Bruce was VERY loose (drunk?), which led to some hilarity such as the pull your pants down bit and starting Back in Your Arms in the wrong key. He opened with the fantastic Beautiful Reward on the organ and then Reason to Believe on the bullet mic, a lousy instrument on boots and nearly intolerable live. After a bit of listening to what sounded like Bruce screaming nonsense into a microphone, a nice but somewhat boring Devils and Dust into a fabulous Empty Sky on electric guitar. Next came long time comin'-it was great to hear this live, but the lack of backing instrumentals took something away. The next song, however, Black Cowboys, sounded eons better than on the album. From that haunting gorgeous performance, next was an equally beautiful Back In Your Arms (as previously stated, started in the wrong key.) Then what may be the ultimate For You (after the pants down speech), and another bullet mic song (Johnny 99, not that you could tell). A haunting State Trooper and a fun All I'm Thinking About led up to a very strong performance of a mediocre song, Cautious Man, and then Reno, which I hate but was probably not bad. The next two songs were easily the highlight of the night-Lost in The Flood and Real World. Gorgeous duo. Two of his best songs sung in their element. He pulled out the electric for two more songs, a decent Rising and the great new Further On, before nearly ruining Jesus Was An Only Son by interspersing his banter through the song. Then a pleasant Two Hearts and a strong Hitter, before closing the first set with Matamoros Banks, a song which I have no clue why he thinks is so good. The encores were without exception fabulous. A great ukelele I Wanna Marry You was followed by another highlight, Open All Night in basically original form, and the acoustic Land of Hope and Dreams, which is as close to a showstopper as you can get in an acoustic show. The no-longer-new Promised Land followed, and then a surprise harmonica only rendition of Dirty Water, which was loads of fun. Finally, the never-ending Dream Baby Dream closed the show (ok, so excellent encores with one exception!). The show had some flaws (bullet mic, Dream Baby Dream), but overall was a gorgeous performance by Bruce of some of the all time greatest songs.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Ian</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Amazing show last night at the new \"Gahden\". Bruce put on another fantastic show, taking us through his back catalog. At one point he began playing the piano in the wrong key, got to the first verse and said, \"too many songs not enough time\" how true. I could have sat there on the edge of my seat forever. Opening up with \"My Beautiful Reward\" got us off to a great start. Even though I was hoping to hear \"Racing\u2026\" or \"Incident\u2026\" I was treated to amazing versions of \"Back in your arms\" and \"For You\", which he said was probably one of his hidden gems. Talking about his Ballads, he said if he had of known then what he knows now, well he would have made more\u2026\"Coz that's where the money is\u2026\" Also, the firm beleif that every song in Rock and Roll is written with the tag line\u2026\"Can I get in your pants\u2026?\" \"It's a town full of losers and we're pulling out of here to win\u2026 and can I get in your pants\u2026?\" \"Baby we were born to run\u2026 and can I get in your pants\u2026?\" Amazing show and a treat to see a musical legend and songwriter at his best. Throwing in an impromptu version of the Standells, \"Dirty Water\" capped a great night off. I could talk for hours on every second of this show. Come back soon Bruce.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Ian O.</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">I attended both the 10/28 show and this one, and I couldn't say that one was better than the other - each had their own merits. The stage both nights was not at the end but in the center, in the style of the stage at the Democratic National Convention. This made for only enough room for three sections on the floor in front of the stage. In the crowd tonight: John Kerry and his wife Teresa. With seventeen songs being different than from the previous night, Bruce was definitely energetic and talkative. As he sat at the \"Ebay Piano\" (as he calls it) and played \"Back In Your Arms\" he managed to get through the entire first verse before realizing it was playing it in the wrong key. He then restarted the song in a higher key and played it beautifully. Sitting at the piano, Bruce spoke of the morals of all rock songs, the essence of rock and roll itself: \"Every song asks the question, will you pull your pants down?\" He proceeded to play the ending lines of both \"Thunder Road\" and \"Born to Run\" and adding \"..and will you pull your pants down\" to much laughter from the audience. The following performance of \"For You\" on the piano was extremely powerful and was one of the few songs for which he received a standing ovation from the crowd. Changing things up from Friday's show, Bruce opted for the Dobro tonight on \"Johnny 99\" but kept the Bullet Mic. He altered the lyrics a little, leaving out a few verses and repeating others. Very well-performed and I would guess that if \"Johnny 99\" makes it onto the DVD, this will be the version on it. \"There I was in the penthouse suite of the Trump Plaza with two hookers and a ukelele.\" With that, Bruce opened the encore with \"Little Girl I Wanna Marry You\" and then went right into \"Open All Night\" on the electric guitar, dedicating it to a woman who was celebrating her 91st birthday. \"This is for you, Happy Birthday! And will you pull your pants down?!\" Ooohhh Bruce\u2026 Closing with \"The Promised Land\" Bruce moved to the organ. Having been to five shows this tour, I was obviously expecting \"Dream Baby Dream\", but Bruce instead asked for a \"B-Flat Harp\" which apparently confused the roadies because it took them a few minutes to get him a harmonica. The ensuing acapella-harmonica style \"Dirty Water\" had the whole Garden on their feet. Bruce then finished with \"Dream Baby Dream\" as usual, though he didn't leave the organ until he finished the song, foregoing the final verses which he usually sings by himself in the front of the stage. I would have to say that the performance of that song on Friday night was much superior. Overall, a fantastic show with amazing energy. It might have been a bit disappointing if you were looking for Bruce to pull out major rarities and tour premiers, but with cameras rolling both nights, he was spot on and at the top of his game, simply playing better than he has any of the other times I have seen him. Excellent job Bruce, please release that DVD!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Mark McKay Sr.</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Great performance of a kind-of-disappointing setlist. People talk about Boston getting great shows, we havent gotten a \"Philly-type\" setlist in years and years. Bruce was in a great mood even as he squeaked and fumbled through \"All Im Thinkin About\", very funny moment. \"I Wanna Marry You\" was excellent on ukelelee. The more I hear the new album live, the more it grows on me. They were supposedly filming and you could tell, not a daring setlist and he played it pretty straight, kind of a shame. A loose Bruce, is the best Bruce.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Stevie D.</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Beautiful reward.

Well anyways I got through to where I was leaning on the stage. Then Bruce started shaking hands with some people in the first and second rows. So luckily I got to shake his hand and he gave me his white Fender heavy guitar pick from his back pocket. Then after the show he told one of his guys to come over and give me a copy of a setlist of the concert that he wrote. Overall it was a show that I'll never forget. He played for about 2 hours maybe and broke out songs like \"Cynthia\" which was way uncalled for.

And for many reasons. First being that I went down without a ticket and ended up in the first row. As I watched Bruce sing a bluesy, harmonica-driven Born in the USA, I noticed his little table shaking and everything shifting with each stomp. Eventually, several things, including the entire pitcher of water fell and shattered \u2014 Bruce was so into the song and delivering with such intensity that he hadn't even noticed. And the night only got better. I know many are complaining about the set lists and performances, but I have to say that this is a rare glimpse and opportunity to see and hear an artist who is usually so driven and intense on stage, sit back, talk about his songs, relax, and really, really take the time to not only focus on the lyrics, but to dig deep into his cataloge of songs. It has been an unexpected pleasure to hear such songs as: Real World, Tougher than the Rest, Fade Away, Wreck on the Highway, Stolen Car, Incident, For You, Living Proof and finally, Drive all Night! I first saw Bruce and band nearly 25 years ago at the Spectrum on December 8th 1980, so last night was an anniversary of sorts. Highlights: Fade Away was absolutely beautiful. Incident is definitely one of Bruce's best songs and I prefer the piano version to full band \u2014 something more intimate and romantic. Johnny 99, Aint Got You and Open all Night were a blast. It's great to hear I Wanna Marry You. But the absolute highlight had to be Drive all Night! Man, what a powerful performance last night and well worth the standing ovation Bruce got. Hope that one comes around again for some of the Jersey shows. Great show from start to finish.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>Philly Clete</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">First of two at the Philly Spectrum - Bruce's home away from home. The crowd, of course extremely responsive, was very respectful of the tone of the show. (Bruce didn't have to \"scold\" the crowd even once to keep it quiet). Bruce was very talkative for this show, with several great stories and intros, including a hilarious rap about how his entire family lived within a three block radius in Freehold. Excellent setlist, topped off by an incredibly intense version of \"Drive All Night\" (1st time in 25 years) AND the always special \"Incident\". Other highlights for me included \"Fade Away\" at the electric piano, \"Ain't Got You\", \"Be True\" (complete with Bruce cracking himself up twice during the song with his keyboard prowess). Great encores, consisting of \"I Wanna Marry You\" on the ukelele, a rockin' \"Open All NIght\", \"Promised Land\" and \"Dream Baby Dream\". As always, the Philadelphia intensity shone throughout the show.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Thundercrack was a great sing-along moment. Thanks Kyle for scoring great seats and adding another Bruce adventure to our long list of many. Me personally, the 1st night was a little more special because of Incident, Fade Away and the beautiful rendition of Drive all Night. Bruce, put out a great live cd from this tour \u2014 even just the piano songs would be great to hear. Jersey shows coming up. How about The Price You Pay and NY City Serenade?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>Philly Clete</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Wow! I think that the title of this eyewitness account should be the same as one that Backstreets.com used to describe Bruce's Spectrum \"birthday\" show on 9/24/99 - \"The mother of all setlists\". This was the 3rd solo show I've seen of this tour, including the Tower Theater in May and the Spectrum show the night before this one. Bruce was incredibly loose tonight, mildly reprimanding the raucas crowd only once for quiet. As repoorted, Bruce switched SEVENTEEN songs from the night before (how can someone not go to back-to-back shows at this rate!), even though I couldn't tell that the incomprehensible opener tonight (Johnny 99 on the bullet mic) was different from the incomprehensible opener last night (BITUSA on the bullet mic). My only minor criticism of the shows is the use of that electronic device. When Bruce sat down at the piano and said that he was going to \"get obscure\" I knew that our special Philadelphia gift was coming. He introduced \"Santa Ana\" by saying that he didn't think that he had ever done this song with or without the band. Of course, he immediately continued that he was sure that someone out in the crowd would know when it had been performed (I have this song on a bootleg Main Point show from '73). He said he needed quiet 'cause he didn't think that he knew all of the cords. It was incredibly special. Of course, a moment such as this is enough to make any fan's night. But, immediately at the song's conclusion, Bruce told us that he \"was going to push the envelope\". The crowd, truly appreciating what was happening, spontaneously exploded when \"Thundercrack\" started, with Bruce thoroughly enjoying himself at the piano. He \"gave us permission\" to sing and clap along at the finale to the song. Needless to say, the performance of these two gems brought the house down with long, standing ovations. Other highlights included a \"visual aid\" that Bruce used leading into \"Jesus\". Bruce did a hilarious riff the night before, talking about how his entire fanily lived within a three or four block area in Freehold, with a church and a rectory in the midst. Evidently, someone at that show made a poster, drawing all of the homes and bulildings that he talked about, complete with captions. It was vintage Bruce analyzing the poster and commenting about it's accuracy. Other highlights included \"Two Hearts\", \"State Trooper\", \"Used Cars\", which included another very funny introduction, and \"Spare Parts\". It is a joy to see how Bruce can change a song around to work in an acoustic setting. To me, this show was spectacular, among very great shows from this tour. It is fascinating to see how Bruce's shows develop from early on in a tour(Tower Theater in May) to it's last days. The Tower show was incredibly intense, with \"pin drop\" crowds, while these final shows, with incredible setlists, show a very loose performer enjoying the moments along with the crowd. I am so lucky to be a Bruce fan in Philadelphia, home of the greatest Bruce shows of all.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

And that's what was delivered. Opening with a haunting blues version of the totally reworked \"Born In The USA,\" it's easy to see the Boss has been to a few Tom Waits shows. The \"military appreciation\" theme continued with \"D&amp;D\" and \"The Wall\" (with a fantastic verbal into). Song highlights undoubtedly were \"Point Blank,\" \"Downbound Train\"(!!!!!) \"Drive All Night\" (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!), \"Blinded By The Light\" and \"Growin' Up\" from the very early days. Local native Bruce Honrsby walked onstage (Boss: \"This town ain't big enough for two Bruces.\") then took over the grand keys in mid song for a rollickin' \"You Can Look,\" thus driving the Boss to an even more energetic performance. (Boss: \"I guess this town IS big enough for two Bruces after all\u2026\") Duo-Bruce happened again for \"Across the Border.\" Hornsby soloed on pump organ for a tasteful and lengthy gospel-inspired intro, before moving to the grand with the Boss on guitar and harp. The interplay between the two was astounding with shifting solos, rhythmic punctuation of chromatic chords, and communication on both musical and visual wavelengths.<br/>\nAll said, a perfect night in Norfolk.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Bruce's voice seemed hoarse at times. He asked for \"something hot to drink\". Whatever was ailing him physically certainly did not affect his effort tonight. As always, an excellent show. The crowd, however, seemed a bit lethargic throughout, with very little enthusiasm. Without a doubt, the evening's highlight was a magnificent piano rendition of \"Backstreets\", with Bruce stating \"Happy Anniversary, Jon\", referring to Landau and the 30th anniversary of BTR. The song was exquisite, and the crowd responded accordingly. \"Part Man, Part Monkey\" returned after a long absence, with cutting remarks pointed at the \"intelligent design\" gang. Other highlights were \"Does this Bus Stop\u2026\" and \"My Best Was Never Good Enough\". Combine those with the now \"standard\" trio of \"Drive All Night\", \"Santa Ana\" and \"Thundercrack\" and you've got an old-timer's dream setlist. Evidently the crowd has been reading the setlists, though, because they did not respond as I feel was warranted for the latter two.

One of Bruce's best of this tour. Minus Empty Sky, which I felt did not fit with the set list and theme, and I did not care for Best was Never Good Enough, the rest of the show was filled with enthusiasm, passion and beautiful renditions of his work. I enjoy the bluesy, harmonic-driven, ferocious, Howlin'Wolf version of Born in the USA \u2014 intense and haunting. Something very visceral about that particular rendition. Ain't Got You and All the Way Home were filled with energy and Bruce seemed to have a good time playing them. Two Hearts and New Timer were poignant and One Step Up, a beautiful performance. Highlights: Backstreets was simply majestic on piano. The imagery and heartbreak filled the arena that night. Don't know why he hasn't included that one more often. And Drive all Night was powerful, as Bruce belted out the tune with heartfelt passion and soul. Waited a long time to hear that one \u2014 finally. Thundercrack works well as an encore \u2014 Bruce needed something to kick a little life into the encores. Be nice to hear Thunder Road or Backstreets in the encores for closing nights at Trenton. The shows keep getting better. The solo performances of many of his songs have now been presented with a new passion, as the focus is on the lyrics, rather than how intense the whole band can play when Bruce is with the E Street.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

The show, although not as grand as the previous evening, had some very special moments: Brilliant Disguise with Patty was beautifully done. Atlantic City, Used Cars, Frankie and Meeting Across the River were all performed very well. Two for the Road was a real surprise, and to hear another powerful, heartfelt rendition of Drive all Night was worth the price of admission alone. Record this one Bruce for a future box set \u2014 simply amazing everytime!!! Also love the raw, bluesy, harmonica-driven Born in USA\u2014intense. And to cap a great show off, finally, Born to Run!

Bruce still struggling with a cold, but he sure knows how to rise to the occasion. About 5 or six songs into the set Bruce is sitting at the piano and he tells the roadies to remove the electric piano (he did not use it at last night's performance). The roadies seemed surprised, and Bruce says, \"I am not going to be using it tonight, so please take it away\". Of course, they oblige. Bruce then plays \"Frankie\" and \"Meeting Across The River\" back to back at the piano. Fantastic! Patty joins Bruce tonight for \"Brilliant Disguise\" following by a super \"Maria's Bed\", and then \"Cautious Man\". After that, Bruce sits down at the piano area while the roadies carry the electric piano BACK onto the stage. Bruce sheepishly grins and then performs a beautiful \"Two for the Road\". \"Drive All Night\" was excellent again, and \"Thundercrack\" in the encore set was also great. The other major highlight is the acoustic \"Born to Run\" which Bruce dedicated to all of the fans who have supported him over the years, along with the Columbia records executives. Fabulous!

It really doesn`t matter. what does matter is the ever present passion, intensity, and re-invention. this is exactly what I experienced last night at the Hard Rock Live show, it was captivating from every angle, and to me solidified Bruce`s musical artistry-and everything that phrase encompasses. From playing 5 or 6 different instruments to re-working older favorites, the crowd evidenced raw musianship with no smoke or mirrors, just Bruce, out front and alone for all to see and hear-as always giving himself and his visions to you-and this night, remarkably stipped down, awesome in it`s scope. My body floated on every note, bounced on each chord - I was genuinely touched, awestruck once again for 100th million time. It was the usual Bruce magic, it was kinda like seein` an old friend that said just enough to inspire you to keep goin` for that next level. Especially captivating in terms of Bruce`s musical mechanics, was his use of varying the distance that he would sing into the microphone, creating his own back-up vocals, while simultaneously creating a streaming rhythm-all in the same verse. He further displayed his amazing sense of timing and rhythm when he peformed a version of the Promised Land (after dedicating it to local south florida food bank) that included two alternating back beats that he produced impeccably and consistantly dedicated, by striking the body of his acoustic guitar while simultaneously playing the notes and chords, and blowin` mad wind into the harmonica-we`re talkin` serious multi-tasking that Bruce pulled off with ease-further blowing me away. That performance of the Promised Land was, and to me, is, untouchable - a repeating phenomenom in terms of where it takes a person - a definite claim to some sort of musical throne, the evidence was clearly laid out at this show, case closed.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Bruce did a good number of songs on Piano (Meeting Across the River, Drive All Night, and Fade Away among the more memorable), which were some of the best songs of the night. Another highlight or lowlight depending on your perspective was when he butchered Two for the Road by mangling lyrics and screwing up chords on piano, after his stage crew screwed up by not having the right keyboard on stage for him when he was ready to play it. He pulled it together well in the end, and in any case it was good for a laugh. Song for the Orphans was great, a much better live version than the bootleg I heard on Sirius. The arrangement was Bruce on guitar, and he brought out a stagehand to play piano, and he played rather well. All told, it was an outstanding show with a lot of back catalog material.

I've said it all before, about what a great opportunity it was to hear a such a variety of songs hardly ever played. Highlights from the shows: The piano versions of Incident, Real World, For You, Meeting, Tougher, Lost in the Flood, Racing in the Streets and of course, Backstreets and Drive all Night. Beautiful, haunting, intense\u2014every night. Others: State Trooper, Part Man Part Monkey, Ain't Got You, One Step, Maria' Bed, Growin' Up, Brilliant Disguise, Atlantic City, Promised Land, Leah, Black Cowboys, Hard to be Saint, Born in USA, Johnny 99 and Fire. What made this tour interesting was to see Bruce do a reverse of the Dylan thing. To see Bruce step away from the band and stadium anthems, to strip down his songs and make the entire show more intimate and personal with acoustic guitar and piano, was an amazing experience. After having closed with one of the most powerful, passionate, soulfull tours (The Rising Tour), Bruce decided to do something not many, if any other performer could do, and he did it successfully. No gimmicks, no oldies act, no half-assed performances. Just a solid commitment to his songs each night with a desire to present versions that probably would not have worked in stadiums or with the full band. To see Bruce reverse what Dylan had done some 35 years ago is a testament to Bruce's ability as a songwriter and performer, as well as his integrity as a human being. He has managed to avoid the pitfalls of many other rock stars and at the age of 56, re-visit some of his lesser played songs and give them a new life. And in doing so, I feel he has reminded fans of how great his lyrics and songwriting truely is. When listening to piano versions of Backstreets, For You, Tougher, Fade Away, Incident and Drive all Night, you can't help but be swept up by the intense imagery and beauty of those songs. The final show was great. Got to sit right at the side of the stage, by accident. After hearing Song to the Orphans, Saint in the City and Fire, it was like being transported in time to when Bruce was starting out and letting the guts of his songs and performance speak for itself. And of course, fellow Bruce nut, Kyle, was there to witness it all. We closed the Rising Tour together and now this one and I have to say thanks for taking the ride. It's a passion, not obsession \u2014 right? And thanks, Bruce, for another great tour and opportunity to hear some amazing songs over the course of the last few months. Just don't wait forever to release a cd or dvd of this tour. In fact, how about a box set covering Tunnel Tour, Rising Tour and this one \u2014 20 songs from each, a 4\u00a0cd box set in time for the holidays \u2014 next year.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

That\"s the experience of watching Bruce Springsteen and the Seeger Session Band perform, only, in this case, you hope that the girls have become otherwise occupied and the musicians remain as the evening\"s entertainment. Springsteen and his seventeen (!!!) bandmates\" first public appearance Thursday night in Asbury Park opened with a raucous \"Oh Mary Don\"t You Weep\" from the forthcoming album \"We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions\" and it was as if the powder keg blew following the slow burning fuse of the \"Devils &amp; Dust\" tour. The fans that attended those solo performances and sat in respectful near-silence have now been rewarded with an invitation to kick up their heels at the local barn dance. Springsteen was in fine spirits, seemingly buoyed by the wave of noise generated by the almost exclusively acoustic accompaniment - an electric bass guitar did sneak its way on-stage at times during the show. From Marty Rifkin\"s superb pedal steel playing to Charles Giordano\"s poundings on an upright piano that could have been lifted from Netcong\"s Wild West City, the band\"s energy allowed Springsteen to overlook the first rehearsal show\"s few technical glitches, once even joking that disaster had been narrowly averted. What was more striking was the sense of joy exuded by the band. Comprised largely of extended friends and relatives (even Cousin Frank made the cut), the Seeger Sessions Band seemed nearly overwhelmed by the crowd\"s enthusiasm. Immediately following the opening number, Springsteen and guitarist/vocalist Marc Anthony Thompson had a whispered exchange and one sensed it was something along the lines of Bruce saying \"I told you so.\" Later, a reluctant Greg Liszt was all but pushed to the front of the stage during his banjo introduction to \"Old Dan Tucker\" before cracking a smile as the fans cheered. It was a humorous moment but one that will likely disappear from future shows as these players find their stage legs. I will admit that I initially cringed upon the announcement of a Pete Seeger inspired folk album. If Springsteen wanted to do an album of covers, why not some classic country (Johnny Cash or Hank Sr.) or early rock\" Not folk. Not Seeger. But, through the wonders of the internet, the sneak peek preview had me thinking maybe Bruce had something here. Seeing the songs performed live, as would have been the only way to hear them when most were originally composed, confirmed that belief. The rollicking opener was followed by an equally boisterous \"John Henry,\" whose story of man railing in the face of \"\"progress\"\" could have been penned by Springsteen. And it didn\"t take long for an actual Springsteen composition to join the set list as the re-worked \"Johnny 99\" was the show\"s third song and first of six of his own tunes to be performed Thursday, including a countrified \"Adam Raised a Cain\" that outpaced the over sung original. The vast musical troupe did slow things down occasionally to gather its strength and these moments provided the set\"s only missteps. After the crowd surprised Springsteen by shouting back the responsorial in \"My Oklahoma Home\" (again apparently courtesy of the internet preview), he strapped on his harmonica, doused the stage lights and sang a largely unaltered version of \"Devils &amp; Dust.\" Later, the up tempo \"Jacob\"s Ladder\" was followed by a droopy \"We Shall Overcome\" (to borrow from American Idol, the vocal was a little pitchy). After nearly two-and-a-quarter hours, the show closed with \"When the Saints Go Marching In.\" An opportunity to end with a Dixieland romp was unfortunately missed as the full complement of horns \" the always welcome Jukes members Eddie Manion, Mark Pender and Richie \"La Bamba\" Rosenberg and, on tuba, Art Baron \" stood largely idle throughout the mournful dirge. Instead of the big finish the show deserved (think Disney World\"s \"Country Bear Jamboree\" minus the little bear tooting on the cider jug), this version of \"Saints\" ended the evening on a somewhat somber note. While some left the show disappointed (one attendee called the event \"an abuse of power\"), those willing to imagine that the floor of Convention Hall was covered in sawdust left with a smile on their faces.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Seriously, once you are over the shock of seeing a tuba as part of the Jukes, you are blown away by the joyous wall of sound. Bruce was clearly having a blast as was the band - La Bamba and Pender were hysterical to watch themselves enjoying themselves.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">K.A.</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">So I went to Convention Hall last night trying to keep an open mind about what I might see. Me, like every Bruce fan out there, is waiting again to see the E Street Band back again live. So as I got to Asbury I felt the Bruce vibe right away as I had a quick shot and a beer with my buddy at the Stone Pony before the show. The bartender was outrageous by the way? yikes!! As we get in line for the show I was turned on by the old, needs a face lift, Convention Hall. The building was probably awesome in its day. Getting back to wishing for a night of E Street magic and knowing this was not going to be the night. I just hoped for some Bruce magic. Well? I have to say that from the first notes of the night to the end of the show it was one of the best Bruce experiences I have had in 22 years of going to his shows. I've seen every tour from Born in the USA on and I was really blown away by this show. Even without recognizing one song, the music itself carried the whole show. The 17 piece band had a powerful full sound all night. Like other reviews depictions of the show, its gospel, jazz, dixieland, bluegrass, celtic, rock n roll all mixed together and it works. I absolutely loved the sound!!! Even liked all the previously released Bruce numbers being rearranged. Bruce himself was into it all night, you can tell he enjoys this out of his box experience. Soozie was great all night. She most of all looked like she was having fun. Songs that stood out: Mary Don?t you Weep, Pay Me My Money Down and You Can Look But You Better Not Touch. Without going into much more detail I recommend this show for any fan. Try breaking out of your Bruce box and you will love this show.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Steve</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">In a nutshell; YES to this project and the Seeger sessions band. I had listened to almost none of this music prior to last nights show. I watched the John Henry video on Amazon, and downloaded the whole record the other night, but never got around to listening. I had a good feeling that I would like the music, but basically went in blind. Since last week all the press reviews, as well as fan reviews have been harping on how much fun the man himself seems to be having to the point where I had kind of tuned it out. After the first tune my wife, who is a huge fan and has seen many shows, but doesn t pay attention the press reviews, or read Greasy Lake, turns to me and says, He sure is having fun up there!. 18 people on stage. I had to count twice to be sure of accuracy. Somebody call the Census Bureau. But they were tight. The masterful Miami Horns sounded awesome in Convention Hall, with Mark Pender really standing out on the trumpet. The violins \u2014 oh the violins. I love this shit. Marty Rifkin on the pedal steel was also a show stealer. After 30 years of leading and arranging the E-Street Band, Bruce really exhibits his mad skills in this regard, with an 18 piece crew. Ask yourself this; at the typical ESB show of the last 10 years, what percentage of the show absolutely captivates you Blows you away with sheer brilliance Maybe you re a 100%-er, but I m not. I m prolly around 50 or 60%. I have a short attention span, and there has been a lot of repetition in those shows. My point is; out of the 2 hour show I saw last night, I was extremely impressed with well over an hour of it. Oh, Mary, Don't You Weep/John Henry, these 2 to open were great. You definitely get the feel for the evening here. The SSB equivalent of The Rising/Lonesome Day 1-2 punch. Johnny 99/Old Dan Tucker/Eyes on the Prize/Jesse James/Cadillac Ranch/Erie Canal, all good stuff here, nothing mind blowing but good stuff. My Oklahoma Home/If I Should Fall Behind/Mrs. McGrath/How Can a Poor Man Stand Such Times and Live, this is where we take it up a notch. MOH is a Springsteen song. The song was made for him. IISFB was fantastic further evidence that he is doing this project simply because it goes well with tequila Mrs. McGrath is a great tune with a solid traditional Irish arrangement, (arrangement is also reminiscent of The Pogues' Fairytale Of New York). Open All Night, one of my favorite Bruce songs, and I d never seen it performed live. Not my first choice of arrangements, but still, a lot of fun. Pay Me My Money Down, high spirited sing along song. Great stuff. Encore: My City of Ruins/Buffalo Gals/You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)/When the Saints Go Marching In, could have left after MCOR. Fookin brilliant.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Band is tremendous - tight and swinging with a lot of punch. Lots of New Orleans touches, especially in the horns. High points (in terms of Bruce Concert High Point Everyboy Out Of Your Seats) were \"Jacob's Ladder,\" \"You Can Look,\" \"Buffalo Gals,\" \"Open All Night,\" and \"Old Dan Tucker,\" though the whole thing was a barnburner. Only slowed down for \"If I Should Fall Behind\" (done as a Scottish-style waltz,) \"We Shall Overcome,\" and \"When the Saints Go Marching In.\" Everything else was either mid- or uptempo (even if it started slow, like \"Erie Canal.\") Of his originals, he did \"Cadillac Ranch\" in the fashion of \"Iko Iko,\" and substituted the first lines of \"Mystery Train\" for the chorus; \"Fall Behind\" as above; \"Johnny 99\" as an uptempo N.O. shuffle; \"Open All Night\" as a barrelhouse number with a touch of Chuck Berry thrown in, and \"You Can Look\" as an almost-crazed uptempo shuffle, with his patented preaching break in the middle. Whole thing ran two and a quarter hours. Seats were directly to the right side of the stage, second row - we were eye-level with the musicians, about twenty feet away. As with the \"Rising\" shows, the floor was general admission. I'm too old for that. He finally \"gets\" folk music. Apart from \"Nebraska,\" I didn't care for \"Joad\" or \"Devils.\" He seemed to think that \"folk\" means \"morose.\" I've been to enough folk &amp; bluegrass fests to know that it definitely is not, and I think the players he's working with finally got that through to him. He was having a grand time - even took a shot before \"Fall Behind\" (\"I don't usually drink during shows, but I found it's good for the voice. F\u2014-s up the timing, though.\")\"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Ron</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">What can u say, been to every tour since darkness. Bruce never disapoints. This time I was fortunate to take my 18 yr old son. we had a blast! The band is amazing. Bruce is having a gas on stage and the energy is incredible. You have to enter this show with an open mind. Once it starts you cant believe how good 100 yr old songs can sound. Each song is tight and at the same time loose\u2026if that makes sense? Audience participation was great considering the CD was released the same day as the show. Like all shows some songs clearly standout. Pay me my money down, Jacobs Ladder, O Mary dont you weep were tremendous. Open all night was nothing less than amazing. Bruce sounded great, Soozie was having fun and the horn section is out of this world. New Orleans is going to love this stuff at the festival. I recomend this show and cant wait to hit one or two locel ones in june! Enjoy and thanks Bruce you have a new 18yr old nj native fan on board!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Sack Personn</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Great show. Bruce seemed as energetic and loose as I've ever seen him. I know he's a showman and he's 'supposed' to look like he's having a good time, but I think his enthusiasm playing this new material is genuine. The band was unbelievably large, loud, and incredible: four horns (and later six) including a sousaphone, mandolins, banjos, accordion, organ, piano, a washboard (!), two fiddles/violins, upright bass, drums, three back-up singers (but really everyone in the band sings back-up, and four-and-a-half guitars (why the 'half\"? Well, they might let Patti hold a guitar, but I'm not convinced it?s actually plugged in) and a bunch of other instruments that came and went throughout the evening. Anyway, you asked for details, so here goes\u2026 I knocked off work early Tuesday afternoon and drove down to Asbury Park with my friend Ron and I gave him a quick tour of the still broken-down waterfront. They've made some progress down there, mostly demolishing some of the vacant buildings, but it's still a pit. There's a dive-y kind of place called Wonderbar across the street from the Convention Hall -think Stone Pony, only with more chrome and mirrors- so we met up there with Gordo, another good friend of mine who drove down from Boston. After a few watery beers and some cold spaghetti from the all-you-can-eat $12 buffet we headed over to the show. The complex that makes up the Convention Hall is really something else. One half is the Paramount Theater, which has a seating capacity of maybe 1500-2000. Back in its day, it must have been really beautiful. It used to host some of the old-time Vaudeville Acts, including the Marx Brothers. The other half is less glamorous, basically a big boxy gym with about 20 rows of seats on three of the sidewalls and the stage on the fourth wall. I think the total capacity is around 2500. The entire floor area is general admission, standing only. That's where the action is, and naturally, that's where we were. A little after 7:30 the lights went down and the crowd erupted. In the darkness you could make out the musicians with their instruments taking the stage. After a few more moments a single spotlight shown on the stage and settled on, not Bruce, but a little scrawny kid with big hair, not unlike my own big hair back in high school, playing the banjo. The crowd immediately picked upon the rhythm and started clapping along. This went on for a couple of minutes until a second spotlight settled on Bruce picking his guitar strings in that classic knees bent, cocked-and-ready stance of his, eyes closed, and with that one eyebrow arched high, his face contorted as he leaned into the microphone and sang the opening lines of Jesse James. After the first verse the rest of the band kicked in and what a sight\u2026 what a sound\u2026 I read a review somewhere over the last couple of days where the author talked about Springsteen's use of Spector's Wall of Sound for Born to Run and went on to describe the Seeger Sessions as Springsteen's Wall of Folk, and this was that times 10. When the band kicked into O Mary Don't You Weep, I remember even thinking to myself that as great as it was to see this show in such a small venue, it almost felt too small to hold this band. I could almost feel the walls of the convention hall straining and bulging against the music. The night was a two and a half hour roller-coaster ride. I'll give you the set list, and I'll try a song-by-song breakdown but there was just so much going on onstage, that a lot of it got lost in a blur. Jesse James/O Mary Don't You Weep/Johnny 99/John Henry/Eyes on the Prize/Old Dan Tucker/Cadillac Ranch (w/ Mystery Train)/Erie Canal/My Oklahoma Home/If I Should Fall Behind / Mrs. McGrath/How Can a Poor Man Stand Such Times and Live? / Jacob's Ladder/We Shall Overcome/Open All Night/Pay Me My Money Down. Encore: Turn! Turn! Turn!/Buffalo Gals/You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)/When the Saints Go Marching In. Oh Mary is still my favorite from the record and was one of the many highlights of the concert for me. Johnny 99 - I've always liked this song and Bruce had flipped this song around and turned it on its head many, many times. Tonight, it was almost kind of funked-up. I know, that's a lame description, but I don't know how else to describe it. Cadillac Ranch - this one was also reworked Bruce replaced the chorus with the chorus from Mystery Train. Very cool. If I should Fall behind was reworked into a Waltz. Bruce said something like \"A lot of people have told me they used this as their wedding song\u2026 But I've always thought about it as more of an emergency divorce prevention song.\" I think Bruce and Patti then did a shot of Tequila together. True. Mrs. Grath - Bruce said an Irish friend of his called after hearing this song and told Bruce he was singing it wrong. In Ireland and Scotland, McGrath is pronounced McGraw. Since Ireland is the first stop on the upcoming European tour, Bruce said he decided to compromise and wanted to try it singing \"Mc Grawth\" But he sang it like the album and I really like this one. How Can a Poor Man Stand Such Times and Live? - Bruce said he kept the first verse and rewrote \"the second three\". This was a great loud, foot-stomper with lots of trademark Bruce wailing, shouting and intensity. I don't remember the lyrics, but it's clearly about the people being left behind in New Orleans. He prefaced the song talking about how the largest mass displacement of Americans happened during the Dust Bowl and tragically, it's happening again in NO. This was probably the high point of the show for most people, but for me it was the next song\u2026 Jacobs Ladder - Richie LaBamba and Mark Pender made a surprise appearance and squeezed themselves onto the stage joining the other 4 horns. I love LaBamba; he may have more energy even than Bruce\u2026 With the openings notes from the six horns, we went from concert to Church revival\u2026 Think James Brown singing in the church in the Blues Brothers movie. Remember the scene when JB says to the Blues Bros \"Do you see the light? Do you SEE THE LIGHT?\" and Aykroyd goes \"What light?\" But Belushi starts convulsing and his feet start moving and his arms are shaking and he's transformed and screams \"Yes, Yes! Jesus H. Tap-dancing Christ! I have seen the liggggghhhhhttttt!\" as he goes cartwheeling down the aisles. Well that pretty much sums up my reaction to this song as well. Amazing!!! We Shall Overcome had some nice vocals. Actually that's something I haven't mentioned yet. All of the vocalists were outstanding the entire night. Even Patti, I have to admit, was terrific. Open All Night was another completely reworked song that had the crowd going bananas. Pay Me My Money Down featured a good amount of audience participation and closed out the main set with a New Orleans style walk-off by everyone but the drummer and the sousaphone player. Very cool. Now for me, this could have been where it ended. I never particularly liked Turn Turn Turn and I don't think Bruce did anything to help it. I looked at my watch for the first time. Buffalo Gals I've always disliked, going back to second grade. I really hate the word 'gals' for some reason. And if you put it in a song, it just becomes that much worse. I don't know why, I just can't stand it. You Can Look was another completely reworked song. A lot of people loved it, but I can't drink the kool-aid on this one. If Bruce sold out and did a Broadway show like Billy Joel did, this version is what they'd do to the song. I guess you have to hear it. When The Saints - Now with a huge band like the Seeger Sessions Band, you'd expect this to be a thunderous, boisterous and loud climax to a thunderous, boisterous and loud concert. But as I?ve read in another review somewhere, that would be too obvious for Bruce. Instead he sings it with just his guitar as almost a funeral dirge. Singing almost in a desperate growl, it comes off as a prayer. Really powerful, and a nice tribute to the people of New Orleans. Overall it was a terrific show and I'm looking forward to seeing it again when he comes back around to MSG at the end of June.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I went, not knowing what to expect and walked away afterwards, completely impressed and amazed! The concert was one of the most joyous and fun-filled time I'd had at a Bruce show. If you haven't seen the show, the best way to describe it is: Bruce, motivated by the music of Pete Seeger, fueled by the soul of Wilson Pickett, backed by a combo of Bill Hailey and The Comets meets The Brian Setzer Orchestra \u2014 the combo is a lethal one. Bruce is definitely having a blast and the show and intensity in which he performs, proves it. Yes, a few people are saying it's not their kind of show, but that does not in any way detract from the professional \u2014 giving-his-all \u2014 rockabilly, country, swing-time, fun-time show Bruce has given his receptive audience. He's got a great band backing him and he's working them hard. Highlights: The Seeger songs, muscled up by Bruce and the band are intense. Mary Don't You Weep, John Henry, Eye on the Prize and Buffalo Girls are all great. My favs have to be Jacob's Ladder, How Can a Poor Man and When the Saints \u2014 just great, great stuff. Who better to tap into that Americana songbook than Bruce? It's a night of hand-clapping gospel, shake-down the rafters singing, jitterbugging, rock 'n' swing music that will have you dancing\u2026 unless you have no heart and soul. And the reworking of Cadillac, Open all Night and You Can Look are just wild! Really liked Fall Behind as a waltz \u2014 nicely done. Thanks, Bruce, for a chance to witness the birth of something fun and old, new and borrowed and blue. Good luck on the tour. Looking forward to it.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Four Springsteen numbers was all I got but, to my great surprise and joy, this was not in the least bit disappointing as Springsteen and his beautifully eccentric (and large!) band gobbled up the the stage with their evermore imaginative re-workings of some folk classics. And not just what was on the album but some real surprises too, like the gorgeous version of 'When The Saints Go Marching In' (though maybe this wasn't the perfect choice for a closing number). Of his own four songs to get the makeover, a drastically different 'Johnny 99' went down a treat as did 'You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)'. 'Adam Raised A Cain' was a bit too unrecognizable for my taste while a heart-rending version of 'My City Of Ruins' was particularly memorable. Springsteen's stage presence was, as ever, awesome although this time he was playing out the new role of 1950's country-rock star a la Elvis Presley or Johnny Cash. Also appreciated was his apology for mis-pronouncing 'Mrs. McGrath'! By the time he'd sang it all was clearly forgiven though! All in all, a brilliant night of Springsteen and the type of performance that deserves to rate among his (and the Seeger Sessions Band's!) best ever.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Greg O'Leary</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Perhaps these songs resonate well in Ireland because it has a folk tradition not a million miles away from that of America, a fact evidenced by Bruce's inclusion of the Dublin broadside 'Mrs. McGrath' (complete with incorrect pronunciation) in the setlist. Whatever the reason, the man and his band were rapturously received by the full house at The Point. Personally, I have never heard a tighter, more acclomplished band than The Seeger Sessions collective - although there were a number of changes from the album line-up. With the full horn section, upright base and piano playing they called to mind Beuna Vista Social Club at their best and most exuberant. It should be noted, however, that this music was never sterile. The nature of this music demands spontaneity, and that is what was on offer, from tuba interludes to lap-steel solos and banjo fills. 'Johnny 99' was a revelation, with a quasi-Bo Diddley beat underpinning angular guitar stabs. 'Open All Night' featured doo-wop backing singing and Little Richard-esque piano pounding. The closing 'When the Saints go Marching In' was unlike every version of that song I have ever heard before, while 'My City of Ruins' was graced by immaculate harmony singing. Given that The Point venue is only 100 yards or so from Ringsend, I thought it would be worthwhile to include alternative, local lyrics to Mrs. McGrath that date back to the publication of the original version itself: 'Let me tell you a story that will give you a shock, it's about a murder in the Ringsend Dock. Well the woman in question was Mrs. McGrath and she strangled two sailors with the straps of her bra\u2026with me too-ray-ay,' etc. Frivolous, yes, considering the weighty nature of the actual song - foreign war and a mother's pain - but then, 'My Oklahoma Home' manages to be both hilarious and affecting simultaneously. Perhaps that is the highest praise for Springsteen's gig; namely that it manages to be an enjoyable experience with plenty of feel-good emotion, yet these songs are also significant for anyone, regardless of nationality.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Too many of the crowd seemed to be waiting for Bruce to adopt his e-street persona but man they were at the wrong gig if that was the case. The hair stood up on the back of my neck on \"How can a poor man stand such times\", what an emotional performance! His arrangements of all those old songs really brought them to life and made you appreciate the strength of the material.

Strong songs, unfamiliar to a rock audience, performed by a superb band that is distinctly different from E Street, yet delivering the same message and the same fun. An early highlight was was Eyes on the Prize, with beautiful lighting effects and a great richness to the sound. Another (unexpected) highlight was (a live world premiere) How Can I Keep from Singing - far superior to the album version, with Patti taking solo vocal early on. From that point on, the show was irresistible. Open All Night absolutely rocked. My City of Ruins was beautiful (back to the original horns version), Jacob's Ladder and Pay Me My Money Down both brought the house down. The acoustics at MEN are dreadful, and this caused the crowd to fail to pick up on the lyrics for a join-in piece on Cadillac Ranch. In general, the audience started our pretty diffident, with the upper tiers mainly seated until late on in the show - but joining in well for all the new material, and cheering each song loudly. All in all a gig that compared favorably with many E Street Band shows I've been to - but just short of being one that ranks amongst the very best.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">JH</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Great arena and a fantastic show.

The Boss does folk somehow didn't sound too encouraging. The first listen allayed my fears and, knowing that his music is always better live, I set off to Manchester with the same confidence I've always had since first seeing Bruce many tours ago.<br/>\nWalking away from the concert my wife and I agreed that Springsteen is so consistently superb that he beggars belief! This show was astounding. The band he has assembled sounded more live than live if that possibly makes sense, and Bruce's voice was as strong as it's ever been. The songs from the album already sound familiar and the audience soon picked out the bits they could sing back. By the time they got to Pay Me My Money Down we were all singing back in the best traditions of Hungry Heart or Badlands. A nice bit of comedy thrown in too with the enthusiastic tuba player staying center stage whilst the rest of the band exited stage right. Bruce's showmanship came to the fore when the audience failed to pick up the chorus for a much different version of Cadillac Ranch. \"That's miserable!\", he good naturedly shouted. \"We need some professionals\" as the backing singers seamlessly took over. As usual there were so many highlights it's hard to remember but I particularly enjoyed an emotional Eyes on the Prize and a rousing Jacob's Ladder. My City in Ruins was also as good as I've heard it. The thing I'll remember the most though is the sheer exuberance of the show. Bruce was clearly enjoying himself and it showed. There were a few diehards leaving the arena muttering that he could have done Thunder Road, etc but that's for another day.

I've seen Bruce on many occasions over the last 20 years and this was up there with the best of them. It all sounded so happy as if the band was really enjoying the occasion and not merely going through the motions - not that Bruce ever has sounded like that but some bands do. From the opening chord of \"John Henry\" he had the audience in the palm of his hand right through to the closing, muted yet incredibly powerful \"When the saints go marching in\". A night of joyful celebration and of music how it should be played with warmth, humor and passion and above all consummate skill. A great rock'n'roller, a great troubadour and a wonderful story teller. The man is a legend and I count myself very fortunate to have seen him again.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Stacks</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Really uplifting show- Bruce really into it.

I hadn't even got the new album then! Managing to get a ticket (not easy) I wasn't sure what I was going to get, but being a big fan of Dylan and Guthrie, I wasn't at all upset with the non-traditional Bruce (my fourth gig so I wouldn't mind seeing something other than the rock show). Although 17 people is a Big Band, they all played well and the music proved to be a big crowd winner - originating from simple campfire music, it's natural that everyone should sing along with this stuff. And the old decor of the Apollo made the band look more at home than most venues would, with the cowboy clothes and instruments, so nothing was out of place. As for the music, absolutely great folk stuff through and through, so nice to see someone rework really historical stuff so well, and see that those songs mean just as much today as they did when written. Even the back catalogue stuff (Johnny 99, Cadillac Ranch, You Can Look) worked well with the new old-style interpretation, although some more Tom Joad stuff could have been fitted in nicely too. But there's only so many hours in a day and there's no way he could play all that everyone wanted - we'd still be there now! Bruce back on top form\u2026 I wonder what he's going to do next?! It's amazing that music from so long ago should be so much better than today's music, well done Bruce for bringing it back mainstream again! Another top-notch show from one of the world's best entertainers! Here's looking forward to his next visit, whatever tunes he plays!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Thanks to enthusiastic folks (including a few friends) in the balcony who were dubbed 'the light-shakers', Bruce repeated two songs for the cameras - bonus!

To all those who feared the entire Seeger Sessions thing was going to backfire: sleep peacefully!! I have at least a dozen Bruce concerts under my belt now and I can assure you that last night's show was memorable, surely among the best I have seen. A sold out and fully packed Forum infact had a wild party as people danced, laughed, jumped and most of all sang along for about two and a half hours, including all those who had not bought the cd yet and didn't know the songs\u2026 I am sure they are dropping into the next music store today! The switch from r'n'r to folk music has not chipped away one bit of Bruce's energy and intensity when performing live and it was obvious to everybody that the man was having as much fun as we were. He was in very good shape and spirits and he often joked with he crowd. The Band was wonderful, sounding like they had played with Bruce for a very long time and not only a few weeks. I also liked the fact that Bruce gave them all a lot of space. The show includes lots of violin, banjo, piano, accordion and horn solos, not to mention Bruce often sharing the mic with a great Marc Anthony Thompson. It's very difficult to pick some highlights given the general intensity of the show, so among the Seeger material I will only mention Jacob's Ladder for turning into a collective and joyous ritual. On the other hand Open All Night (a song I always loved so much) was the most striking re-arrangement of his previous material, receiving a '40ish coat of paint thanks to a Radio City Music Hall-style vocal intro sung by Patti and the girls. Ramrod was a tour premiere and Bruce introduced it with a touch of irony saying \"This one we're doing for the first time here in Milano\u2026 and maybe last one, if it stinks. So we need your help with the singing\u2026 you know, in case it tinks!\" Moreover, for the first time in the tour Bruce didn't close the show with When The Saints Go Marching In. Soon after he had walked off stage and the rest of the band was following him, in fact, he got back and added a cheerful Buffalo Gals to the list. Finally, I need to mention the fact that during the speech before When The Saints he sent the crowd wild by saying \"See you next fall\", which he repeated twice afterwards. So it seems like the Seeger experience will be longer than expected or, in alternative, there's a new E-street adventure around the corner.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

On the 16th of May my wife and I traveled to Frankfurt from Denmark by bus. We traveled with approx 150 other hardcore Springsteen and we had high expectations. I was looking forward to see my big idol for the 6th time. We arrived in Frankfurt on the 17th 7 in the morning, after a hard ride from Denmark to Germany, hearing lots of Bruce music and people on the bus were all discussing the new music, different Bruce stories, how many shows we\u2018d been to and so on. Personally I`d only sleep for two hours, because I sad next to the \u2019Fernabranca gang', who were all pretty drunk and singing (or a least trying) lots of Bruce songs. So I was very tired when I got out of the bus, so my wife and I rented a dorm at the price of 50 euro, just to sleep for 4 hours. We eat in a road side pizza bar before the concert and a German guy, saw my Bruce shirt, and asked me if I was going to the concert? And as we started talking, he got that 'I like Bruce Springsteen too' look in his eyes as we shared Bruce moments down memory lane\u2026 Nice guy, I never got his name though, but as we talked his girlfriend got a big laugh as she looked a her guy with big grin, thinking 'Men will always be (Bruce) boys'. 'Festhalle' in Frankfurt was great and had a high sealing, so there was lots of room for the 17 man big orchestra and their great music. People went nuts and several times Bruce had to give up on comment between the songs, due to the crowd's noise. Once he said \"Do you have some sort of love festival going on\". And yes we did!!!!!! The new music was great and again my compliments to the German Bruce fans (my 3th concert in Germany: Berlin 99, Hamburg 05 and Frankfurt 06) - you really know how to behave at a concert!! In Denmark people are always drunk, shouting and noisy, its not like that at all in Germany, people here tent too care for the music - THANKS!!! It makes the whole trip from (approx 1000\u00a0km) very easy. Highlights for me at the show was \"Mrs. McGrath\", \"When the Saints Go Marching In\" and \"Long Black Veil\". Only person I missed was Patty and of cause ?If I should fall behind? but instead I got Wolfgang Niedecken with the best hair cut in all of Germany.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

High points of the concert were definitely Jacobs Ladder (when the crowd finally took off, and the humming during Erie Canal, disturbing Bruce's intro into the next song) The singalong from Pay Me My money down, carried on until the start of City of ruins).

I am 43 years old and I've seen a lot of concerts. The 'special' ones are a dream-like memory for me now, like when I caught the newly formed Clarence &amp; the Red Bank Rockers in a small, oversold night club in Boston, sweating and high-fiving each other through a high octane set of soul classics like \"Try a Little Tenderness\" and \"Sweet Soul Music\". Tonight was somewhere around my 15th Bruce show, and, when I heard he was doing a Seeger tribute I was more than a little skeptical. But, I liked the album. Then, when good seats were still available in the Boston area the day of the show, I privately worried if Bruce hadn't finally lost a little something off of his fastball. But tonight I saw something different. I saw my folk, blues, ska, rock, swing, jazz, dixieland, ragtime past flash before my eyes. And I saw something else: I saw folk, blues, ska, rock, swing, jazz, dixieland, and ragtime's future and its name is Bruce Springsteen. And on a night when I wanted to feel young, he made me feel like I was hearing music for the very first time. Seriously folks, if you are like me and missed out on the 1970's tours, and always felt a little sorry that you hadn't caught Bruce when he was performing his classics with the enthusiasm that comes with inexperience, or, maybe you just want to catch a little magic, then check out one of these shows!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Rob B.</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">I am reletively new to the Bruce world (this was third show), but I am not new to live music.

I had the privilege of witnessing The Boss at the Tweeter Center in Mansfield (Boston) Mass. last Saturday night, May 27\u00a02006. My worries ended right about the time he walked up to the mike and bellowed \"hello Boston!\" The showmanship proved to be brilliant! Only Bruce Springsteen can place a ragtime band in front of Rock and Roll purists and completely entertain them. Only Bruce Springsteen can turn a Rocking number like Ramrod into a Polka (or Ska) and make it sound great. Only Bruce Springsteen can vividly paint a portrait of the pain of government indifference which the great people of New Orleans are enduring at this very moment, which is the purpose of the Seeger project. His compassion for those folks is genuine. The horn section was outstanding. The backup singers including his wife Patty, were performed powerfully, and the violins were superb. I am 46 years old and have seen The Boss in 1978 (Seattle), 1980(Seattle) and 1986 (Los Angeles). I have always told my friends that these were the best concerts that I have ever seen. The show in Boston the other night was very special to me. For my own tastes, Rock and Roll is really the only music that can move me. However, thanks to Bruce, I was able to feel the music of another great American composer. Someday, everyone who enjoys music of any kind, will acknowledge what some of us already know, and that is, Bruce Springsteen is the greatest artist in American history. Someday in the distant future, some young and talented artist will be performing \"The Springsteen Sessions\" in the name of human decency and civic awareness. I'll be in line for those tickets too.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

It's hard to find the words to describe what this show was like - \"incredible\" just doesn't cut it.

You take Springsteen's talent, enthusiasm, and showmanship, and put it in front of a band playing any kind of music, and amazing things happen. I'm a longtime folk music fan and Seeger fan, but last night showed different this music can feel and sound, when imbued with Springsteen's spirit and fronted by someone of his immense abilities.

The best way to describe the Seeger Sessions Band's performance is one big jam session. At one moment, it might be the 6 piece brass section's turn to absolutely swing, the next, it might be the dueling fiddles (Suzie Tyrell on one), or some killer pedal steel guitar solo. Not only has Bruce creatively breathed life into old folk standards, but his alternative interpretations of his own material (Johnny 99 and Cadillac Ranch in particular) are remarkable. One cool moment was when Bruce mentioned that his cousin Frankie was in attendance, and he told a great story about Frankie having taught him to tune his first guitar and to play his first chords, when all he knew at that time was how to pose with the guitar - something he readily admitted to still being very good at! This segued to an intro of Frank Jr., one of the guitarists in the Seeger Sessions band. Other blasts from the past included Richie \"La Bamba\" Rosenberg of Miami Horns fame, although Mark Pender stole the show on trumpet whenever the horns were blasting - he was amazing. In closing, if you're on the fence for seeing this tour, let me say that this was a better show than many of the nearly twenty E Street Band shows I've seen over the years.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Tom Cantillon</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">After having seen the Asbury Park shows, this was my first show of the tour proper and I was impressed. I had been a bit concerned about going from the intimate Convention Hall to an outdoor venue, but it worked. Bruce and band came on charging out of the gates with an intense Mary Don't You Weep and John Henry! And in typical Bruce fashion, he kept the train a rollin' for a solid two and half hours. The crowd, at least in the 300 section was mixed as far as dancing and responding, but for those who joined along in the fun, it was a singing, dancing, hand-clapping jubilee! The Folk tunes are rejuvinated with a new life with the band and horn section. Great set of musicians Bruce has got working with him. Highlights: Johnny 99, John Henry, How Can a Poor Man, Jacobb's Ladder, Pay Me, Jesse James, You Can Look, a beautiful Fall Behind, and a rockin', jump 'n' jive Open All Night. Great night from start to finish. If you haven't seen the show, put on your dancing shows and go have some fun.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

This show continues my legacy of seeing at least 1 show for every Bruce tour since the 5-26-78 Darkness show. (My first concert) The facility was an open air bowl covered with a roof, but with a grassy area in the rear as well. We got tickets about 1/2 way under the roof on the right side of the stage. It was on the verge of being a bit too hot, but still a great night for a Bruce concert.<br/>\n<em>\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab\u00abNOTE\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb If you like to have more then a drink or 2 before or during a Bruce concert, you WILL probably want to skip this part. I am about to be 44, and I have not consumed alcohol for over 20 years, mostly because I was just bad at it. \"Nuff said about that\u2026 So, why oh why do I always get stuck next to the drunks? If you were at the show last night, you soon will know exactly where I was sitting. Ok kids, look around at the next Bruce concert you attend or recollect the last one you attended. Let's face it; most people at a Bruce concert now are at least 40. Didn't most of us leave the obnoxious drunk days behind back in the 80s? There is a razor thin line between expressing musical exuberance and being extremely annoying to those around you who also paid $100.00 to see the concert. Before I even sat down in my seat for the first time, I knew that 1. the 50ish year old woman 2 seats over had driven 500 miles to see her first ever Bruce concert, and, 2. was already well on her way to being falling down drunk. Shortly after this discovery they left and hoped they would not be back. It was not to be though as they returned during the first song with more drinks. The mildly drunk husband was reasonably cordial offering the use of opera glasses to whoever wanted to use them. She immediately popped up screaming \"WhoooHooo\" every 45 seconds. She then was yelling indistinguishable things during the quiet song breaks, apologizing for it, then did it again 10 seconds later. After 25 minutes of this, someone 2 rows back yelled \"sit down bitch\" and the real fun began. The slightly more drunk husband made 3 half hearted drunk attempts at defending his wife's honor by jumping across the seats and tried to issue a smack down before the security arrived. They were then \"reassigned\" elsewhere, possibly to the grass to never be seen again. Now I ask you, was all of this really necessary? \u00ab\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab\u00abBack to the concert\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb</em><br/>\nIn a slight continuance of the above subject, I did notice for my past 4 concerts covering 4 years, a majority of attendees, myself included, spending the majority of the concert seated. I remember seeing the Born In the USA shows 20th row center at the now gone Veterans Stadium in 93 degree heat, standing on my chair the whole time being completely spent when it was over. Flash forward 21 years, and now that there is no real \"front row\" I guess I will never get that close because I can't stand up in the \"PIT\" for that length of time now. Yes getting old sucks! I remember trying to tell the various people I have taken to Bruce concerts over the years how Bruce will control the standing and sitting parts without ever saying a word about it. They did not understand what I meant until they experienced it themselves. Bruce came out at about 8:15. I just could not get used to seeing ALL those people on stage playing as the band with Bruce! If you also follow Southside Johnny as my friend Harvey and I do, it was great to see Mark \"the Love Man\" Pender, Eddie \"The Kingfish\" Manion, and of course LaBamba blowing on the trombone! They just rocked it out form the first note. While the new album has not knocked me out, I do enjoy it as a diversion of Bruce's talents. The Jungleland sax solo, with all the house lights pumping to Mighty Max's beat and the opening piano of \"Incident on 57th Street\" on the night I went backstage in 1999 will be really tough to EVER eclipse. However, the 2 songs I was really hoping to hear last night, \"Mrs. McGrath\", (my fav from this album) and \"\"How Can A Poor Man\"\" which should have been on the album was played back to back. The reworked \"Open All Night\" was awesome. This will go down in the record books as the Bruce show that included a tuba solo, something I NEVER thought I would see. Bruce was a bit more subdued in outright political comments then he has been recently. It was there, but mostly in the songs. Again the sheer number of performers on stage was something that you must see. It reminded me of what the short lived \"Bruce Springsteen band\" shows must have been like, except there was not a chess game being played on stage this time! In conclusion, if you have not seen this tour, you really should I doubt that something like this will ever be repeated again. If you read the second paragraph and were offended, tough! Read it again and think about it or just don't sit next to me.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

My wife went with me although she did care for the Seeger album. She had a negative attitude towards the whole thing. That changed very quickly. She is only of her 5th or 6th show and may finally have realized just how great Bruce really is. She was amazed at how Bruce was able to put music from an album she thought was more or less ridiculous into such an amazing show. As for me, I am on about my 28th show now and am still amazed. I had looked at the tour's setlists and was ready for him to come out with Mary Don't You Weep and John Henry, and instead I got the tour premiere of Atlantic City \u2014 unbelievable.For everyone that likes Bruce at all you need to go see these shows to see how he transforms songs from Nebraska to full blown stage productions. The thought of people dancing in the aisles to Open All Night is not real until you see this tour. Atlantic City under went another transformation and is better then ever. Bruce always has surprises for everyone with different songs and playing Froggy (for the first time) for the 7 year old in the front row who gave him a little stuffed frog is a great example of how he can stray from his playlist at the drop of a dime. Bruce once again showed that he is the greatest live performer of our generation. Can't wait to see the next tour and what else he can pull out of an ever growing bag of tricks.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Even tho the place wasn't packed (good thing, easier to get close) the audience was into it. Let me put it this way. There was absolutely no way you could NOT sing along with the entire show! The different takes on Atlantic City, Johnny 99, You Can Look, and Open All Night where simply great. Keep an open mind about this tour, because after all, isn't that what Bruce is all about?

Bruce was looser and happier than I have ever seen him, clearly enjoying the music and I think enjoying the creative freedom of not having to play Born to Run, etc. for the umpteen millionth time. There was a sense that both Bruce and the audience approached this show with an openess and lack of expectations that was refreshing. The crowd was all solid Bruce folks who clearly trusted Bruce to take them wherever he wanted. No one was yelling for \"Rosalita.\" Although it was L.A., the show did not have a \"big event\" sort of feel. Tom Hanks was there, but I think we can count him as a real Bruce fan by now. While a casual observer might see this whole Seeger Sessions thing as another big rock star making an oldies cover album and basically going through the motions, nothing could be further from the truth. Bruce has made the Seeger songs truly his own, and if you haven't heard the new versions of the Springsteen songs, be prepared for something completely different. It is beyond my limited musical vocabulary to explain how these songs sound, but these are really completely different arrangements and completely different takes on the songs. Open All Night really stood out, complete with doo-wop vocals from the \"red-headed women.\" Roy Bittan was seen in the audience and went on stage for the last song before the encores. Not only did he play a riveting piano solo, but he stayed on stage as each of the SSB musicians left, until it was just Roy alone on stage banging on the keys for awhile. Quite a tribute by Bruce to his longtime piano player to feature him like that even though he was only making a guest appearance. Among the SSB members, guitarist/vocalist Marc Anthony Thompson (aka Chocolate Genius) really stood out. He duets with Bruce on \"Eyes on the Prize,\" \"When the Saints Come Marching In\" and others and really adds a depth to the show, especially the songs dealing with the civil rights struggle. The show has very definite political overtones, and Bruce made a couple of references to Bush, as well as to an issue that has gotten a lot of attention in L.A. involving a community garden in South Central L.A. that low-income Hispanic people have been using for years and now some developer wants to build condos on or somthing. Bruce also made some funny L.A. references (\"there is no carpool lane to heaven,\" \"don't give me that 'I'm too cool to sing' shit\"). All in all, one of the very best Springsteen shows I have ever seen. I really hope this is not the last we see of the SSB. I would love to see Bruce write some songs with the band in mind and explore some more of the older folk stuff. This strikes me as a longterm side project, rather than just a one off. Although I love the E Street Band, it seems to me that as Bruce pushes 60 years old, this new musical direction may be a better fit for where he is at.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Mike Lintz</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">A beautiful nite &amp; what a beautiful noise.

Yes there was a profesor in the house tonite &amp; he had fun. Bruce came back once more and leaning on the edge of the piano with yhis huge smaile on his mug ,just enjoying roys musianship for another minute before ending the solo along with roy &amp; departing together. A beautiful moment. I also had the good fortune of meeting roy on the way out &amp; shaking his hand I wrapped my arm around his shoulder &amp; thanked him.

Lots of fun. Bruce had a lot of good-natured fun at the expense of the LA crowd. He was constantly busting our chops about our unwillingness to sing along. In defense of my fellow city folk, the music wasn't very loud (at least where I was sitting) so if you sang along, you could really hear the sound of your own voice, which can always be a bit disconcerting. Plus, it's hard not to get a little tired after singing the chorus for Pay Me My Money Down about two hundred times in a row. Johnny 99 was truly bizarre and strange, as was Ramrod, but both still enjoyable. These versions are impossible to sing along to and almost unrecognizable from their previous incarnations. Jacob's Ladder was a real highlight as was The Saints Go Marching In. It's always awesome to see the look of joy and amazement on the faces of people who have never seen Bruce in concert. It's truly a life affirming experience.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

The rockin \"Open all Night\" had the crowd in frenzy. Bruce also saluted one of the horn players mother, who drove in from Kansas City. He also made light of the National Pork festival going on the same night as the concert. \"We'll all hook up with you later and maybe we can have a hot dog or something\" Classic Bruce, able to communicate with the audience like no other.

For me, this is the music I've been waiting for from Bruce. Go back and listen to \"The Wild, The Innocent and the E-Street Shuffle\" - it starts with a crazy horn burst and progresses with an ensemble of musicians, rock and roll norms be damned. \"New York City Serenade\", any one? I've longed for those days, probably because I was just young enough not to see those shows. This latest amalgamation, The Pete Seeger Sessions Band, is the Boss coming back to his roots - a musical orchestra that blows down the walls of the halls! And the show in Chicago last night was just that - Bruce blowing into town and blowing down the walls. The set list was not much different than the other shows being played - but, oh, what power, and what fun. Live, each of the songs from the new album packs energy and heart to burn, specially when everyone sings it out with the band. That's the idea. The reworked songs all work well - the only one I would call out for striking me as odd is \"Johnny 99\" - but that's a minor call out. It gave me a chance to catch a breath. I understand that this was the debut of a reworked \"Further on Up the Road\". Beautiful vocals from all the singers made this heartfelt ballad a welcome to all. Highlight of the old material for me was \"Open All Night\", which was always one of the funniest of Bruce's songs for me - the new version, a big band boogie in which Bruce sort of raps his way through it, was hilarious and fun and amazing. Bruce's politics of humanity, of the people, were in force and I welcomed that. Folk music is music for folks, and we are all folks. Time for \"How Can a Poor Man Stand Such Times and Live?\" and \"Bring 'Em Home\" to be released. Are these getting any radio play? Is anybody playing this disc to the masses? What else? The crowd continuing to sing \"Pay Me My Money Down\" as the band left until they came back out was great - almost as if the entertainment was paid for, so pay it down, but also a great unity of a few singers in the crowd. The \"Buffalo Gals\" closer was alot of fun too, but here's a suggestion to the Boss - you need to close, solo acoustic of course, with \"Froggie Went a Courtin'\", as the last line \"If you want anymore you have to sing it yourself\" is a natural to end on. I prefer to be brought down easy! And all in all - Bruce himself was hilarious - caught in Chicago road repair traffic, goofing, laughing - really great to see. It's been a while since I laughed so hard at a concert. It was strange, but cool. For me, this is what Bruce was always destined to do - lead a crew of as many musicians as possible. Thanks, Boss - what's next?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\"><em>bronxkid1</em></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">I hate to sound like everything I have seen or heard about this tour but I will. I had no intention of going to this tour at all, which flys in the face of my rule of almost 30 years that if Bruce is anywhere within 150 miles of where you are standing you must go to see him or else you are crazy. What else are you going to do, watch TV? The show, which I attended with my 7 year old, was fantastic. I'm not gonna say the Seeger Session material is my cup of tea because it isn't. But the music, the band, the emotion, the general aliveness all made up for it. Even the remakes were mostly of songs I can live without, yet, they all sounded awesome, especially Open All Night. I have said for a long time that I would love material from Bruce that is R&amp;B/gospel/rock blended and you certainly get that from this new material. And bravo for taking a chance with stuff many in the \"\"fan base\"\" will resent and even stay home for. I can't stand predictable artists or oldies acts. The highlights in this show for me were Long Black Veil, Further on Up the Road, Open All Night, and When the Saints but truly, there were no dull moments. I think I will reinstate my rule forever. Bruce never lets you down.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Funniest non-scripted moment was when someone in the VIP area in front of stage was smoking pot. A lot of us on the floor could smell it. Finally Bruce said \"Whoa! Someone's smoking a lot of dope out there. I might not be able to fulfill my contractural obligations!\" and that drew a lot of laughs from the crowd. Then he added \"keep it away from the horn section, ok?\" to which the horn players held up their arms as if to say \"why!?\"- very funny moment.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Then he and the band did an amazing version of MARY DONT YOU WEEP, a great song about satan attempting to taking souls and other biblical references and that another empire's army went down as well. What an amazing song!@ This woman was in shackles but the singer was saying not to weep because all armies fall. This song was an africian spiritual. And bruce rocked it up to be an uplifting redemption song. Then one Bruce's darkest songs in his catologue, Johnny 99. He changed the music to reflect the mood of the concert. It is about a person that couldn't take all the crap that society threw at him. From banks taking his house and piling up in debts and the police and the courts harassening him. He changed the song to make it sound like it was an old traditional song as well. It fit in perfectly. Then the comic relief of the album came up, which was old dan tucker. Even in that song with all the humour dan gets redeemed by going in the arms of the girl that he loves best. Next was an amazing song about the civil rights struggle, people despite being in jail, kept their eyes on that freedom as human beings that they deserved. Bruce for that song, brought the music down so the words can be focused on. Before each song Bruce put each song in a historical context, to frame what the topic was and who wrote the song. And even that song, ends with a redeeming bit about how the streets of heaven are paved with gold. It was amazing to hear a band that never played together before to be conducted by bruce and sound that good. Bruce wasn't really the bruce we know with the east street band for this show. The next song bruce talked about what people think is the legend of jesse james, and what is the actual true story. Jesse James seemed to be like a robin hood, It was cool to see bruce dispelling the myth of jesse. Next bruce took a great rock and roll song about the famous biblical parable into a song that the words were altered and the music scaled down for this show. ADAM RAISED A CAIN. He made this version focus on the part of his father struggling as a working class person in this country. Probably done to affect the present times of many americans right now. That is why it was done a lot more somberly. Then Erie Canal was altered as well to make it more of a cheerful singalong. And how nature can bring a lot of people together. Next he did a song about the dust bowl storms of the 30s blew away his home. Similar to the storms of katrina. They took the place they love and called home away without any aid or assistance at all. The song is OKLAHOMA SONG. Then an altered version of his rock and roll song FURTHER ON THE ROAD. This was altered to more an unknown quality with sliding towards probably not. It was very strangly down, many people around me wasn't sure if that was even a bruce song or not. Next the irish version of Mrs. MCGRATH. A great song with a very pretty sing along part, this song bruce stopped at the beginning and mocked the fact how people always love to clap along, and he said \"dont u listen to the words? this isnt the type of song to clap your hands to.\" This is a song about someone losing their legs in a war with a cannon ball. \"All foreign wars I do proclaim Live on blood an a mothers pain I'd rather have my son as he used to be Than the King of America and his whole Navy\", that verse bruce added to the song, to bring it up to date, that was an amazing thing that bruce did to many of these songs like pete seeger did as well. Then bruce did a long rap about how the government didn't do anything for the people of new orleans except give chaney more halliburton handouts. He talked about this government of financial cronism, and until this stops, this madness wont cease. He then changed the words to reflect the poorus condition in new orleans. CALLED HOW CAN A POOR MAN STAND SUCH TIMES AND LIVE? The next song the band sounded like the BAND doing JACOB'S LADDER. it is a universial song about everyone working together to get to heaven together. What a gorgeous sentiment! Then probably the best moment of the night. Bruce talked about all americans getting off their asses for this song. And how the need for political protest songs are vital in these times, and sang WE SHALL OVERCOME, that version brought chills to me, it was done so amazingly. Bruce changed some of the words to that as well. Next a scat version of OPEN ALL NIGHT came on, it wasn't noticed but it was a nice relief from that the seriousness of the last couple of songs. So it was done in a rock a billy style. Then PAY ME YOUR MONEY DOWN. A rousing number of people wanting to get paid from the wealthy or else they go to jail. Bruce turned that into a sing a long and a long jam as well. For the first song, bruce did an incredible version of the Pete seeger's song IF U LOVE YOUR UNCLE SAM, BRING 'EM HOME. Bruce got most of the crowd to sing along for that song. BUFFALO GIRLS, was sung next, a song everyone as a child knows, and he did a very pretty version of that song. a fun uplifting song. Then an altered version of YOU CAN LOOK BUT BETTER NOT TOUCH. It appeared that the song showed an the llusion of the media it seemed to reflect. After the song bruce talked about how the media are becoming mirrors for illusion in these times. Very powerful stuff. And then the show ended in a real surprise. He closed with the real version of WHEN THE SAINTS GO MARCHING IN. That version has the last two verses of universal peace, it was done in a gorgeous way with out the horn fanfare that everyones knows that song to have. His gospel backup singers handled that really great. I personally would've liked him to have done REASON TO BELIEVE, but u cant complain at all. the Music was great and very danceable. It also appears that bruce did this album as a statement against this adminstration. He is very outraged at the direction that this country is going and felt that the old protest songs were the way to speak this message to the public. I also felt that bruce was upset how Bush and corporate america is giving this rosy colour view of what america was and they are whitewashing a lot of the truth, and bruce felt that the old songs would give the story of america the best and educate the audience of americas history musical and with the events the songs were about. Right on Bruce! It takes courage to do what bruce is doing in these times, but it is very nice to hear and see with the great results that bruce did it with.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Shame on you if you didn't try REAL HARD to get to one of these shows. You missed a fun, great time. You missed more talking to the crowd than ever (and a funny dedication to Walt Whitman). You missed an actual vocal competition (some say RUMBLE!!) between the fine folks from NJ and the big mouths from Philly at the start of OLD DAN TUCKER (Get out the way, Old Dan Tucker! You're too late to get your supper!). You missed the rock 'n roll Tuba. Simply, you missed a unique and awesome show. The show started great\u2026 great sound, lots of juice from Bruce and the band, and everyone into the songs. Five of the first six songs were from the album, with a great reworking of ATLANTIC CITY sandwiched in (hey, we're in NJ!\u2026 although the night was nowhere near gettin' cold). The show slowed down a bit at song 7 with the strange choice of MARIA'S BED\u2026 a nice song, but it didn't fit and it was played as if they just learned it from the album. Also\u2026 Mrs. McGrath lost some of it's feel\u2026 it was easily the centerpiece of the Asbury Park rehearsal shows\u2026 it somehow lost it's dramatic impact. BUT\u2026 not to dwell on a few minor negatives\u2026 every song was delivered with\u2026well, every Seeger Session Song had it's history explained, and then each was dead-on delivered with power, grace, and feeling - from the direct and moving HOW CAN to the subtle and powerful rendition of WHEN THE SAINTS. The high point of the show may have been the fast and thumping version of OPEN ALL NIGHT, a song he seemed to love to sing in it's new incarnation, a song the crowd really got into\u2026 and hey, maybe it was a little bone thrown to those of us remembered the first time we heard about \"New Jersey in the mornin's like a Lunar Landscape\". Now\u2026 sinners\u2026 here's a little prayer that these Sessions aren't over\u2026</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Tom Cantillon</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Great show and great crowd in the pit! Highlights: Long Black Veil was haunting and intense, gave me chills hearing it. What an impassioned delivery! Great versions of Mary, John Henry, Jacob's Ladder, Dan Tucker and City of Ruins. Always great to see Southside. When he's around, he and Bruce get so downright goofy that it just makes for a great show and when Southside wailed away on the harmonic at the end of Pay Me My Money \u2014 was just awesome. Highspirited show from start to finish. I was singing the songs all week right up to the PNC shows.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I went despite the rain, and since it was his first show back in Jersey, I expected a surprise or two. Unfortunately, his 'surprises' were not what I had in mind. I, for one, love the Seeger CD, so when he played those songs, he basically rocked, although I hated We Shall Overcome. I also didn't care for his new version of Atlantic City. I thought when he did songs like Old Dan Tucker, Mrs. McGrath, John Henry, O Mary Don't You Weep, etc. Nice additions to the show were also My Oklahoma Home, Bring Them Home, How Can A Poor Man\u2026, Ramrod, &amp; When The Saints Go Marching In. My favorite song of the night was My City Of Ruins, I thought it was riveting, and I've personally never heard it played any better. A lot of emotions ran through my section when he played it. Maria's Bed was not bad either. A few songs he could've dropped were Eyes on the Prize, Open All Night, &amp; You Can Look\u2026 Overall, it was BETTER than expected, and it was Bruce in Jersey. When he wanted to rock, he rocked, and that's what I've grown to love about him. Overall, a good night, not the best, but not bad. I'm still waiting for the E-Street Band, but I guess Bruce needs to prove this whole political situation to himself.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Tom Cantillon</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Of the 9 shows I've seen of the tour, this was the best. Had a blast standing on the lawn dancing all night as Bruce and band played their hearts out. During so many other Bruce shows, I remember singing a lot, but never dancing so much; what a spirited jubilation of folk, blues, rockabilly and gospel music. I remember, at times, feeling the Reunion tour hit some stale moments, but then the Rising Tour hit the road and their was Bruce and band, as energized and passionate as I remember from the River Tour. Bruce and band were probably as good as they'd ever been. Then Bruce did the Devils tour and as it progressed he really loosened up regarding songs and his entire approach to the shows. But people wondered when and if he would rock again. Well, this tour proves he can rock just a shard as ever and I think this music and band further contributed to loosening up Bruce even more by giving him something new to be passionate about. Sure, everyone wants the old Bruce classics, but to get a bunch of \"\"new\"\" songs, sung and played with such enthusiasm, with Bruce having such a blast on stage, this is just as good as any E Street Band show. If you haven't seen the show yet, if he comes around in the fall, see it and join in the celebration of some traditional songs done in typical Bruce Springsteen fashion \u2014 an over-the-top, rockin' good time. Thanks Bruce and band for another great time at the shows and for giving us something to celebrate once again.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

The crowd at both shows were fantastic! Fifteen thousand people singing these old folk songs with Bruce leading the way was very moving and energizing! PNC staff did a remarkable job clearing out the Irish Festival and the accompanying 15,000 patrons and allowing a smooth entry for the concert goers.

I had already saw the SSband in Milan in may and I was more impressed.. maybe because it was NEW. I appreciated the slightly changes to the setlist and the world premiere of the SSband rendition of THE RIVER (very beautiful.. with an Irish mood\u2026with a good whistle part). I heard the first euro ATLANTIC CITY, wich was a very good one too\u2026 The show was much shorter, lasting 2 h 15m\u2026 There little changes in the arrangements of some songs.. IF I SHOULD BEHIND features now an intere verse sung by Patti for example, JACOB LADDER features a new intro that seemed to me like Bruce was jamming with the band and the backing singers calling the chords changes, E Street band members will say: \"we never need Bruce calling the chords changes\" :-) It's true guys, but the SSband is a new band and you can't compare this kind of things. OPEN ALL NIGHT was a great dance along and it seems that the intro was expanded.. with the musicians introductions.. good choice. I think the last 2 songs were better than the spring tour encores like RAMROD or BUFFALO GALS. In Bologna we had a great gospel song (notes are needed) and another Irish-mood song (but not a ballad..that was a DANCING one!!!) I read on your setlist that was AMERICAN LAND\u2026 great great. All in all a really good show in Bologna, Bruce was great but in Milan he blew me away at my 15? show\u2026 only he can do it. Sorry for my English folks but I'm tired:-) many thanks - Matteo Callegari</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Francesco</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">IT was for me the 1st SSB-show and I've found it really amazing. Bruce created a wonderful charming \"country-fair\" atmosphere, that takes you on a ride through different ways to feel the spirit of the popular music: from boogie-rocking to gospel, from Irish-tunes to waltz. All you can do is abandon yourself to this magic, sing, move your hands, move your legs and dance. Greatest moments of the night, I think, \"The River\" opened by the irish pipes, the incredible \"Open All Night\" &amp; \"Jacobs Ladder\" with a soul introduction, and the final encores This little Light of Mine\" &amp; \"American Land\": during this song, all the people exploded with joy and happiness! Strange for me was \"Atlantic City\": I should listen to it again to better understand: the song has surely a great intensity in the final, as the sound keep'on rising as Bruce's voice sing \"C'mon and meet me\u2026\" but in the beginning he left me surprised. The palace was full, but there was place enough for dancing: in the rear of the arena, you could find some completely crazy couples dancing together like in a waltz. Fantastic! Bruce seemed happy to be here; he started, saying in italian that \"7 is a lucky number\" as he named the 7 italian cities where he will do his shows. He clap his hands to the crowd after our chorus in Old Dan Tucker and for 2 times he asked us with a \"ssssssssht\" to stop our singing, because he could not start the other song. You know, we italians wait for Bruce, to find again the real joy and the happiness, to sing together. Finally, he gave us, one more time, in one only night, the chance to set us free from all the pain and the uglyness of the day-by-day. He's great. He's the greatest.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Good performance for \"\"Oklahoma Home\"\", with more refined vocals than the version I saw in Milan on last May 12th. \"\"Long Time Coming\"\" was another pleasing presence: it's a real shame that the hand written setlist brought \"\"Growin' Up\"\" in the same slot\u2026 \"\"Poor Man\"\" also powerful, while a new version of \"\"The River\"\" had its way through the crowd, followed by the swinging \"Open All Night\". As for the encores, new life was brought by \"\"Rag Mama Rag, This Little Light of Mine, American Land\"\", played with the whole place jumping around. Great performance anyway, maybe compressed for the upcoming radio broadcast (just figurin' out\u2026). 2h 10m concert convincing in every aspect.

If I do say so myself, we, the crowd, we in fine voice throughout, taking up Bruce's cue in 'Froggie went a courtin' that if 'We want anymore we can sing it ourselves' and singing the whole first verse again before the band rejoined us.

Some have described this as reggae, some as ska. Not really sure what it was, but it really rocked. Great harmonies, great energy. Followed by two standards of the tour, John Henry &amp; Old Dan Tucker. Further on the up the road was almost unrecognizable, very slow, Gospel-like sound. Jessie James &amp; Mary, don't you weep were two more from the album &amp; given the usual treatment. Bobby Jean got a thorough working over, followed by Erie Canal &amp; My Oklahoma home. The Ghost of Tom Joad was one that actually sounded quite like the original, very low horns &amp; a similar feel to the album version. Great versions of Mrs McGrath, How can a poor man?, and Jacobs Ladder. Long time coming was followed by a slow, gospel sounding Jesus was an only son. I don't particularly like this song, but was impressed by this version. Open all night started with the horn section doing a do wop singalong before the band came in &amp; made it sound like a rock &amp; roll song from the fifties. Nils Lofgren guested on Pay me my money down, but there didn't seem to be enough room on stage for him. Bruce nearly clouted him with his guitar. The encores started with Bruce strumming the intro to My City of Ruins, with the band joining in slowly building up to a big climax. You can look got the rock &amp; roll treatment, before a subdued When the saints. This little light of mine was followed by the Pogues-like American Land. The show seemed to be over but Bruce decided we deserved a bonus. Froggie got the singalong treatment. 2\u00a01/2 hours of great entertainment with a great crowd and actually for once I was impressed with the venue.

Nor did the idea of another new band fill me with enthusiasm at first. But there is something about the material and this band live that is very special - I suspect that's the whole point of Bruce's 2006. The best way to describe this gig is to say that I was captivated from the first note to the last. The combination of Bruce quite clearly having a great time and a talented band, each taking their time in the spotlight, is truly inspiring. The highlights were many. Excellent re-working of Blinded, early raucous sing-a-long to Old Dan Tucker, string of stirringly played SS songs and best of all in the main set, a great re-working of Growin' Up and Devils and Dust, which works so much better with a band. The gig then upped another gear with Pay Me as Bruce coaxed the audience into standing and singing to a level not often seen in the UK - Bruce was clearly thrilled. As if to defy anyone to think things couldn't get any better, Bruce then debuted an interesting new song - looking forward to it being recorded/released (please!!). The last four songs choice now works perfectly - Saints (poignant, beautiful), Little Light (uplifting), American Land (just a great song) - and then, finally, a bonus Froggie (great fun). Most of all, however, I shall remember this night for two things - first, the sheer joy of it all, both the band and the audience and second, the performances of the Bruce and the band - a mixture of raw enthusiasm and utter professionalism - and, if there's just one specific comment to finish on, it has to be the sheer effort expended by Art Baron playing the tuba. So, what next? Solo, E Street or more Seeger Sessions or perhaps some combination of the latter. For me, it just doesn't matter. Whilst Bruce is as committed as this, anything he does will be just fine.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Mikey G.</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Just got back from a 400 mile round trip to see Bruce and the \"Sessionaires\" at Wembley Arena. What a show! Since the earlier Euro tour the band have really tightened up and seem to be playing with much more confidence and Bruce just seems to be having the most fun he's had in his life! Good audience participation and great sound (I was ten rows from the back of the Arena but the sound was crisp, no echo at all, so congrats to all concerned! The highlights; versions of Atlantic City and Growing Up, Poor Man, it's just a great song, but best of all, a world premiere of what Bruce described as a work-in-progress: \"A Long Walk Home\" It's great that he has been writing songs whilst on tour. Lets hope it's 3 albums in 3 years to make up for all those lean times! Roll on Sheffield!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Paul Watson</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">A great show with fantastic energy; Bruce and the band all seemed to be having a great time. The setlist was pretty typical of the tour, but with a few unusual features:<br/>\nFirstly, there was no real encore \u2014 after \"Pay Me\" the band sort of made to leave the stage but never did, and the set continued through to the \"American Land\" after which there was a break for bows and applause before the band returned to their positions for a closer of \"Froggie\". But the traditional leave stage/applause/return to stage ritual was not performed. Secondly, between \"Pay Me\" and \"You Can Look\" we were treated to a brand new song. Bruce described it as 'a work in progress' and made some strong comments about the need for healing and recovery in the US after 'damage to democracy' that had happened in recent years. The song was called \"Long Walk Home\" \u2014 the lyrics were not overtly political, even though the intro was, but it was clearly a melancholy sort of song. All in all, a great show \u2014 very different from, yet easily equal to, the E-Street Band tours of recent year. Much fun.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Tony Turner</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Great as always the revamped versions of Atlantic City etc were good but will never beat the real version with the e street band. I thought devils and dust was excellent as were pay me my money down, how can a poor man stand such times and live. 24 songs sung on this occasion crowd were on their feet from Jacobs ladder onwards Bruce made reference to a comment he made at Crystal Palace The Rising Tour about getting our English arses off the seats to dance he said his achieved hes goal. He also said sorry Patti's not here my kids are Teenagers and if we left them alone with a fire they would burn the F##king house down. Great night.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I make these comments after being surprised and engaging at how good Paul Simon was at the same venue two night earlier. The main difference between his show and last night's show from Bruce - the songs. I love the Seeger Sessions album, but at some points it all blended into a New Orleans jam - I was reminded of \"\"Heart Attack and Vine\"\" on a couple of occasions when it went a bit mad! Don't get me wrong, it was a great show and my fiancee, at her first Bruce show (bless her!!), loved it. The appeal of the show grew as it went on. But the outstanding moments for me were Bruce's songs, not the Seeger Sessions songs. \"\"The River\"\" was, in my opinion, the best I've heard it with a wonderful arrangement and \"\"Open All Night\"\" was a fantastic riot - Bruce at his best totally transforming the song into an indispensable monster. It was so good that the song that followed, expected show-stopper \"\"Pay Me My Money Down\"\" felt anti-climactic. And that for me was the problem. I love the Seeger Sessions album but I felt that we were missing Bruce's best stuff - \"\"Blinded By the Light\"\" and \"\"Does this Bus Stop\u2026\"\" made a great start, but I wasn't sure of the arrangement for \"\"Johnny 99\"\" - seemed to lose its impact. \"\"Further On (Up The Road)\"\" was lovely, but I think that song is (forgive me for saying it) served best in Johnny Cash's arrangement. Lovely singing, though. And \"\"Bobby Jean\"\" - fantastic. Absolutely fantastic, really capturing the essence of an often overlooked song. \"\"Downbound Train\"\" would have worked well in this type of show, I felt. But then so would so many of Bruce's other songs. In 1992 I was surprised at how good Bruce was on the Human Touch-Lucky Town tour - I loved the show in Dublin I went to. That show began with an acoustic version of \"\"Seeds\"\", which would have been perfect last night. This year, I was surprised at hw much I missed Bruce's songs. Maybe I appreciate them more by their absence. But \"\"Downbound Train\"\", \"\"Seeds\"\" et al would have made this a more balanced show. As the concert went on, the middle third of Seeger Sessions album tracks moved into the incredible \"\"Open All Night\"\". The encores were exceptional, with \"\"Land of Hope and Dreams\"\" a real stand-out stripped down to a mostly acoustic arrangement - better than the previous E-Street version. Wonderful stuff. \"\"The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze\"\" was a great, fantastic, wonderful, finish, a beautiful song to end on, coming after a Pouges-tinted (and suitably riotous) version of \"\"American Land\"\". What a pair to end the evening on. It ended better than it began, and Bruce's few chats with the crowd (a real disappointment he didn't talk more, when he did he was as funny and engaging as ever) made mention (twice, I think) of the Seeger Sessions \"\"experiment\"\". I'm not sure we'll see the likes of this again at Wembley and I will always cherish having seen it. But I also never realised how much I'd miss Bruce's songs, despite having heard them live since Slaine Castle. Next time, its back to Bruce I think!\"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Andrew Derek Kenward</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">This was my first ever Bruce concert (allthough being a fan for about 3 years). It was absolutely amazing, from the first moment when he got up on the stage and sung \"Blinded By The Light\", to the last moment when he sun \"Man On A Flying Trapeeze\". This was an absolutely amazing experience and i am so glad i went even though i am only 15. I will definately be at his next concert. There is only one thing that i can say about this show: it was absolutely awe inspiriring. From the moment he steped on the stage until the end. He started off with a complete new rendition of Blinded By The Light it was all jazzed up. He played songs i had never heard before, Open All Night, Further Up The Road and Bobby Jean. He also played my favourite songs, The River, Land of Hope and Dreams and Long Time Coming. He also played all the best seeger sessions songs alswell. On Pay Me My Money Down they all got in a line and walked off the stage leaving he man playing the trombone (i dont know his name) by hiself, then Bruce got his son to come on stage and take him away. Patti wasn't there, Bruce said she had to stay at home and look after the F***ing kids. I am only 15 years old and i went with my two brothers and a friend to see him, i have been a fan of his for about 4 years now an this was my first Bruce concert. He ended the concert with When the Saints Go Marching In, This Little Light Of Mine, American Land and Man On A Flying Trspieze.

We saw Bruce and his band in Manchester back in spring. That concert was good but this was even better. The musicians are all much more confident and the overall sound is tighter. Bruce, of course, was his usual self. Does he ever give an under par performance? I've never seen one and I've seen quite a few over the years. Long may it continue. There were too many highlights to mention after 24 songs over two and a half hours. I particularly enjoyed Youngstown as Bruce gave a mention to Sheffield and its declining steel industry before delivering a great version of what can be an underrated song. Bring Them Home was touching. We had a couple standing nearby whose son was still out in Iraq and you could almost feel the significance of the words to them.Some of the livelier songs saw Bruce at his showman best. Open All Night was frenetic and Pay Me My Money Down had everyone singing along merrily. I absolutely loved the Pogues-like American Land. Bruce and the band seemed to feel the same! We were stood close to the front this time and it was great to see Bruce at such close quarters and to watch how he communicates with his band. This man is a genius! All in all another brilliant bit of 'Magic in the night'. As usual after one of Springsteen's shows I now have an adrenaline hangover but have the consolation of another happy addition to my musical memory bank.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Andrew</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">This was to be the thirteenth time I saw Bruce since Roundhay Park, Leeds in 1985. I had been to Birmingham and wembley on sunday. I live close to Sheffield so I was hoping this was going to be another good show. I arrived early at 7.45 am and was fourth in line general admission. We self organized the line, effectively doing securities job for them. Due to the persistency and vigilance of those at the front of the line we did get into the venue safely and fairly. I managed to get center front first time ever,a great position. The folk version of Blinded is brilliant in my opinion. Other highlights were open all night, youngstown, and bring em home. I was unable to concentrate on the second part of the show, due to a teenage girl who decided her place was in between first and second row!,head on my right elbow! Her father who had been constantly jabbing me in the back, claimed there was room for everyone! What I was hoping to be a great night, at my local venue, was spoiled by a selfish, inconsiderate family, who were also local to the venue. At the two previous shows, I had stood with Swedish, Spanish, Italian and American fans, no problems.

Tonight a popular rock and roller embraced folk music and emerged triumphant. Thank you for taking a chance on me' said Bruce Springsteen before sending the ecstatic sell out crowd home singing Froggie Went A-Courtin' Ironically the opening song, Blinded By The Light, came from his debut album when he was hailed as the latest 'new Dylan'. As with most of his own songs performed tonight it had little in common with the version on the record beyond its lyrics. Backed by a sixteen piece band, including a four piece horn section, almost every song was treated to a glorious wall of sound unlike anything normally heard by the rock and roll audience. As early as the second song we experienced the bizarre phenomenon of a rock audience cheering a banjo solo. The show featured a generous helping of Springsteen originals, all reworked for the new band. None worked better than The River, transformed into a wonderful mix of folk and gospel. If there were such a thing as an Irish spiritual, this is what it would sound like. Acknowledging Sheffield's role as a steel city the Tom Joad song Youngstown received its tour premiere, sung as a duet with guitarist Frank Bruno. The standing crowd on the arena floor was in good voice throughout, especially on the songs Erie Canal and Oklahoma Home. During the latter Bruce manfully carried on, just managing to avoid laughing as a lone voice shouted 'blown away' at the wrong point. Introducing another song from his debut album, Growing Up, Bruce apologized for the absence of his wife Patti who was at home with their three teenage children. 'Those kids just won't behave' he explained, 'We must have gone wrong somewhere'. During the singalong finale to the main set, Pay Me My Money Down, Bruce turned to the stands and announced it was the 'moment of truth, time to separate those Sheffield asses from those Sheffield seats.' Everyone complied, seats and asses remaining separated for the remainder of the show. After a refreshingly brief pause, the six song encore opened with a rare outing of Pete Seeger's anti war song Bring 'Em Home. Introducing When The saints Go Marching In he said that this song explained what the show was all about. The slowed down arrangement worked perfectly with band members Marc Anthony Thompson and Lisa Lowell each taking a verse. Before Froggie Went A-Courtin' sent the crowd away happy there was one final bar room blast from the band, a Spingsteen original written especially for this project, American Land. A case of \"Tonight Matthew, we're going to be The Pogues\". Pete Seeger allegedly threatened to cut the cables with an axe when Bob Dylan picked up an electric guitar at the Newport Folk Festival. Although this show was probably even louder, I'm sure he would have approved.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Kevin Turner</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">What a great night! Went to the Manchester gig in May and I thought this was better. Might have been because we were standing up for this one. The band didn't come on stage til 8.15 due to an accident on the M1 and stayed on stage until 11.00 with a one minute break. Lots of fun, energy and great great music. The horn section were superb. Highlight for me was the re-working of Atlantic City, the rendition of Youngstown for \"Steel town\" and American Land. The audience really appreciated the band and during \"Pay me\" everyone in the house was rocking. Great stuff Bruce.

Choice of songs was average although the Sessions tracks came out very well and who cares what his political opinions are? Wish he would keep them to himself he is an entertainer by definition - stick to it. Call me old fashioned Possum but why can't he keep his fruity language to the locker room.

I've been a bit sour on the old boy of late I have to say. 'Devils and Dust' didn't do it for me, and I wasn't blown away by the Seeger CD - it's just not my particular taste in folk music unfortunately. But, never underestimate the power of the live Bruce. This show was great, full of fun, passion and power. There was little talk, just lots of astonishing playing by an incredibly tight band. The highlights for me though were the simply stunning reworkings of some of the old songs. 'The River' and 'Atlantic City' just took my breath away, probably worth the admission price on their own. 'You can look' wasn't far behind. A clean and uncluttered tour debut of 'Youngstown' worked nicely too. Lark-about highlight: \"Time to get your Sheffield arses off your Sheffield seats. This is your arse; this is your seat; separate 'em\". Everyone duly did! Bruce remains a staggeringly good performer (I think in the years between shows I forget just how good sometimes), and has amazing energy for a bloke not that far away from his sixties. He still looks like he loves every single second of the ritual: \"I'm going to ask you that same dumb-ass question you've been asked at a 1000 rock and roll shows - do you feel alright?\". We did. Wonderful. Come back Bruce \u2026</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Murray</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">What a thrill to go to a Bruce concert with my 26 year old son who had converted to Bruce about a year ago and is now as fanatical as his dad. He has gone back through the whole catalogue and has an Ipod full of the Boss. I have seen Bruce many times and recalled stories to my son of the E Street band gigs-so many highlights in my my life of unforgettable nights.<br/>\nLoved the Manchester Seeger show which I attended with my wife who stepped down this time for my son. I was a little nervous that the gig was not going to live up to the hype my son had heard about for all these years. Then WOW \u2014 Blinded by the light with the crowd roaring back BLINDED at each chorus and we were all systems go.No warming up for Bruce but as usual he goes straight for it-giving all and nothing less. Band even better than Manchester,confidence sky high. Highlights so hard to define so many but The River what an arrangement-what a buzz to hear my son sing with me \"no wedding day smile, no walk down the isle , no flowers ,no wedding dress\" \u2014 Magic. More sing along Seeger then \"Well they blew up the chicken ranch in Philly last night\" \u2014 even more Magic. I could enthuse and enthuse about each song but hey whoever is reading this knows where I am coming from. What a start what a middle and what an end even with Bruce and the band going a la Pogues. Cant wait to go to the next tour with the E Street band whenever that may be. Manchester United in Barcelona 1999 and Springsteen nights- memories memories memories that will never fade.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Suddenly, the stage is teeming with musicians, and we're off. The opening chords are a little unfamiliar, until we hear \"Well they blew up the chicken man\u2026\". Rollicking, storming versions of \"John Henry\" and \"Old Dan Tucker\" really set the mood. As with \"Atlantic City\", some more Springsteen standards get the Seeger Sessions treatment, notably \"Growin'Up\" and \"If I Should Fall Behind\". It's wrong I know, but I'm thinking \"sing one of yours Bruce, and sing it straight!\". And then he does. \"Devils &amp; Dust\", and later, a beautiful version of \"My City of Ruins\" were pure Bruce. The main show finished with \"Pay Me My Money Down\", although we didn't know it at the time. The fact that we were being entertained by a lone tuba player while Bruce slept on a piano stage left, should maybe have given the game away. For the encores, \"Blinded by the Light\" and \"You can look\u2026\" were performed in their Big Band versions. I thought \"Oh when the saints\u2026\" would be a brassy, happy-clapping \"Get your Irish arses off your Irish seats!\", singalong riot. Instead, it was stripped down to it's gospel roots, with various band members sharing the vocals. Finally, what better way to end the night than with the very Irish influenced \"American Land\", as performed by the Bruce Springsteen Ceili Band. Brilliant. In 2hrs 40mins, with hardly a break, we'd been treated to most of the musical styles that have influenced American music. A masterclass from a master. What a band! What a sound! What a show!

Great performance again from the entire band-vocalists in particular. Bruce did not leave the stage for the encore but pretended to be asleep stage right before pulling the lone Tuba player off.

First time i heard it with a full backing band.Bobby was all right, Shenandoah while he sang a good version of it the tempo of the song did not fit in with the others.The crowd were in very high spirits from the very start and that made for a great night.

Always nice to see the show from a new angle. The incredible interplay between the band members was revealed in all its glory. It's been a feature on the autumn leg of this tour that the show just seems to blast by, I've been to my share of Bruce concerts over the years and I honestly can't remember any shows being as tight or as lacking in 'down' moments, 2 ' hours have never gone by so quickly. The crowd were VERY enthusiastic; after the subdued nature of the Norwegian crowds it was a real treat to get to see a crowd really enjoying itself. There was only one downer and that was the ridiculous seating ushers who wouldn't let anyone stand. They hunted us down mercilessly with flashlights and at one (absolutely insane) point, during Jacobs ladder ' 'get your ass off your Irish seat' moment in the show if ever there was one, the guy behind me was accosted by no less than 3 marshals telling him to stop ruining the show for those sitting behind. Quite how they thought that this behavior was enhancing the show for the rest of us is anyone's guess. Anyway, the show was a blinder. The man himself sabotaged the marshals efforts at the beginning of 'Pay me my money down' with the usual 'The time has come for the separation of the Irish seat from the Irish ass!' When everyone stood at the same time there really wasn't much the marshals could do. The absolute highlight of the evening was, for me, hearing Bobby Jean, a song I last heard live in Milan at the San siro on the Rising tour. It never fails to make me cry, and the tears were flowing freely here. I was blown away by how good the River sounded, and by the incredible finale of Light of mine/American land. In the end this show did what all good Bruce shows do: Took all my emotions and put them in a blender until I had nothing left to give. I was drained for a good 24 hours afterwards. It tore through me and left me wondering how on earth it's possible to enjoy any other artist live.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

It was worth every bitter second. Hugely energetic and joyous, the show started with a bang and went on from there. I don't think I am capable of saying anything that hasn't been said before, probably more eloquently as well, but if that was the last gig I ever got to go to, it would be a great one to finish with. It was good to see a use of more of the musicians and singers ranges and talents than in the first round of the Seeger Sessions tour. For me, it added greatly to the warmth and depth of the performance as a whole and brought new color and texture to the songs. The reworking of some of the old favorites into the new formula was interesting at worst and wonderful at best. The atmosphere in the Arena was good, (not, for me, as quite as good as Sheffield) and nearly everyone was having a great time - I was at any rate. As an oldie who stood and sang Bring Them Home in front of the American Embassy in the sixties and seventies I missed this song on this final night, but hearing the other Seeger songs and hearing the audience singing them was fantastic - it's what music is about! As usual - the Boss is the best.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Johnny</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Amazing, amazing, amazing!

I believe in the cause/benefit for Parkinson's but a lot of the people were ONLY there to see Bruce. It is unfortunate because there were a lot of talented Jersey bands and they don't get the credit they deserve. Don't get me wrong - loved seeing Bruce but let's us not forget why we were all there and hopefully that was to listen to some GREAT rock n roll and for a good cause.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

He played a slow, mellow version of The Promised Land and then started Rosie. He got about 2/3 of the way through it and basically said screw this, bring everybody out and start over. All of the performers came onto stage and Bruce asked for 'volunteers for versus'. He turned to the lead singer from The Hold Steady and said \"You're in\" (as if he would say no), and then turned to Badly Drawn Boy (a personal fav who looked like a deer in headlights) and said \"I know you're good for one too\".

Being a rehearsal show, the band was getting a fele for the new material, pacing the set, mixing in the old while constructing a theme. Overall, they did a fine job, but some tightening and tweaking will go a long way. Radio Nowhere was ok, needed to be more powerful, which I'm sure will as the tour moves into gear. No Surrender is a decent song, but perhaps Prove it all Night, Cover Me or even Open all Night will rock it a little more. The pairing of Empty Sky and Something in the Night lead for an emotional moment as both songs deal with loss, one physical, the other spiritual. Nicely done, with the band really nailing Something. Gypsy Biker \u2014 too new for me to tell yet. Girls in their Summer Clothes, Night &amp; Promised Land worked well together as Bruce and band started off with a Beach Boy's-sounding tune, carefree and easy going, to the urgency of Night and then to stand firm in the hope and faith of the Promised Land. Devil's Arcade killed the momentum. But then an energetic Candy's Room and blistering She's the One re-juvinated the show. If Bruce were to possibly add How can a Poor Man and Badlands to that mini set \u2014 the 4 would be a highlight of the show without a doubt. My Hometown was OK, but there are so many other great songs they could play: Tougher than the Rest, All that Heaven will Allow, Spirit in the Night or Reason to Believe would work. The Rising, Last to Die and Long Walk Home all worked well together as they brought to our attention the sacrifices made for this country and the fact that we still have a way to go to mend so many things that have created a sense of disillusionment and frustration. Really nice job there. The encores, well, they definitely examplified that old E Street Band magic as they tore into Thundercrack and Born to Run, following with a rousing Darlington and American Land. The encores reminded anyone there of the real \"magic\" the band is capable of and will surely produce as the tour rolls along. It would also be nice to see Bruce take some solo piano turns, perhaps playing such classics as: Incident, For You, Drive all Night and Lost in the Flood. Feels good to have the band back.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I started off the on the south side of the building where in the past, if they opened the first set of double doors, on the side up on the balcony, you could see part of the stage. It turns out, this time they had the north side opened. I listened to Radio Nowhere, Prove It All Night, Lonesome Day and Gypsy Biker on the south side. In the meantime, every now and then people were heading past me and towards the back of the building, so during Magic, I took a walk over, and discovered that the north side's beach and boardwalk were mobbed with fans. The first set of double doors on the balcony was open. The combo of Night and She's The One was amazing. I was so glad to see She's The One performed because recently, for some reason, I've become completely obsessed with that song, even though I've known it for years. After that, I went up on the boardwalk. The sound wasn't as loud from the boardwalk, but I went back and forth between the boardwalk and beach to get different views of the stage. Darlington County went right into the full band version of Born In The USA. BITUSA was the highlight of the show for me, since even though I've seen Bruce and the E Street Band 15 times, I've only seen him play that song twice before, and one was the acoustic version. Devil's Arcade sounded great, and I like that one the best out of what I've heard of the new stuff. The crowd outside went wild during Badlands, with people all around me pumping their fists up in the air. I've been dying for 4 years since the last time I saw the E Street Band to pump my fist up in the air to Badlands. Bruce acknowledged the people standing outside a bunch of times towards the end of the show, and dedicated Girls In Their Summer clothes to those outside. And of course, Thundercrack and Born To Run were great.

This is her best work and yes it is her husband's band. He and Patti show the world that you can have a marriage that survives time, an extremely successful rock and roll career, and a raise your kids in a normal private setting. I find it amazing and even more reason to embrace them. McCartney put his inexperienced and musically untalented wife much to her personal protests on stage and his audiences grew to accept it despite her \"lack of musical training.\" Patti not only has a degree in music, but happens to be a very talented songwriter in my opinion. It is always difficult for women to break into a man's world particularly in a band. Her husband is an American icon and I am sure she realizes that her role on a tour with \"his\" band has to be that place she has created for herself over the years. However, she kept the homestead raising little Springsteen's while Bruce kept on rocking for all of our sakes and now she deserves to have a \"little\" spotlight. What is the difference in their performing one of Patti's songs together or the band performing another artist's song which he has done over the years repeatedly? I adore Bruce and every \"family\" member of the band. Let's look forward to many great times to be had and any offering he chooses to make is fine with me.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Unknown</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">I was standing 4 deep right in front of Clarence. It definately takes lots of energy out of him. He rarely pulled out his deep sax (alto sax?) but played while in its holder. it was a practice though. Last tour I thought might be his last. But he is a bit older, and all things considered, we are lucky to have him up there on stage as an integral part of the band. Overall it rocked. and it rocked real hard. Solid transitions, great guitar work by Bruce and Stevie in particular. Max is always amazing and banged on the set harder than any time I've seen him. Can't wait for more. Wish more were these shows. I'm forever spoiled. I felt like we were observers that weren't supposed to be there.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Friday's show was amazing! Now, for those used to seeing a Springsteen concert, this one is a bit more streamlined and it works. The show is faster paced, more powerful and lively as the band bursts into old favorites, while adding in new material. Radio Nowhere was more impressive tonight than at Monday night's rehearsal. Ties that Bind was great to hear. I still think Cover Me or perhaps even Saint in the City would work in the number 2 slot as well. Lonesome Day was very good, but I'm not digging Gypsy Biker. The lyrics are buried beneath the wall of sound and screaming guitars. Might work better acoustic. Magic, I liked. I think it needs another slow song paired up with it, perhaps Brilliant Disguise or Two Faces would work. The double shot of Candy's Room and the blistering She's the One had the crowd on its feet, singing and cheering as the band tore through both songs. They should remain a concert staple without a doubt. Now, this is just my opinion, but I think the pairing of both might benefit from a third song added only because the intensity from both, although much appreciated by the crowd, seems short-lived as Bruce moved into one of the new songs. I would like to see any of the following added to that pairing: The Fever, Fire or even Because the Night would all do justice to that set. Livin' in the Future would definitely work much better as a sing along song if Bruce hadn't prefaced it by saying this is about illegal wiretapping and torture, because you just can't sing the song after having those images in your head. A Town called Heartbreak was well done. It's nice to see Bruce shake up the set lists and add even one of Patti's songs because it replaces Mansion on the Hill and it's actually a very good song, sung with a lot of passion. Now, Reason to Believe, done up with a bluesy, Dylanish Highway 61 feel was wild! Loved it! Keep it in the set. People around me thought it was a new song, but everyone seemed to really like it. Darlington County, I enjoy hearing, it's just a fun song. Born in the USA, powerfully done, but needs to be connected with some equally powerful tunes. How can a Poor Man or Lost in the Flood would add a lot to that moment Bruce and band are aiming for. The Rising, Last to Die, Long Walk Home and Badlands are just amazing together. They are all terrific songs on their own, but played together, the 4 are an intense, powerful moment and obvious highlight of the show as they deal with loss, frustration, anger, being disillusioned, yet finding the strength to \"spit in the face of these badlands\" and keep on going. An amazing moment from Bruce and band. And can Max drum any harder? Outstanding job Friday night. Encores were fine as Bruce lightened things up with Sunny Day and Thundercrack. American Land is just great live with the E Street band and a great way to end the show! I hope Bruce might consider adding into the encores, Drift Away because the line, \"give me a beat boys to free my soul/I want to get lost in your rock 'n' roll and drift away\" would bring the show full circle from Radio Nowhere. Outstanding show that I am sure will change as Bruce moves the tour along. But as it stands, it was a solid 9. I do believe now I've gotten my wife somewhat hooked on the shows, and that's a good thing for me. Thanks for a great night of rock 'n' roll, the way it was meant to be played, loud and with a whole lot of passion!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Gypsy Biker, Magic, Last to Die, Long Walk Home, Livin' in the Future all sound good on the record but are MUCH more powerful and clear w/ the band adding layers of sound and texture to them \u2014 they had much more menace, rage &amp; despair than on disc. Even Devil's Arcade, which on disc escapes me, sounded good. Thundercrack was a hoot. And American Land was a rousing finale \u2014 both Danny and Roy were center stage playing accordion.<br/>\nThe downsides: The sound mix is off \u2014 frequently the vocals were drowned out, which was a problem for the new songs; there's a lot of reverb which distorts the piano, in particular. Bruce needs to start the shows on time. I'm not saying they have to go on at 7:30, but starting at 8:30 is RUDE.

I liked several of the new songs (Radio Nowhere, Last to Die) and I thought Town called Heartbreak worked well. But I also didn't hear any of my top half dozen Bruce tunes. Bottom line - the set list needs to shift some to incorporate a few more classics; if Bruce needs to cut show lengths then he needs to take this into account when developing the set list.

The rest of the new stuff suffered from lack of awareness, but that's going to improve. \"Reason To Believe\" is beyond belief - the absolute highlight of the night. \"Night\" into \"She's the One\" was beautiful, especially because the audience's applause was so loud at the conclusion of \"Night\" that you couldn't really hear the intro to \"She's the One\" \u2026 it just sorta snuck up on you and then exploded. I'm going to get blasted for this, I know, but \"Town Called Heartbreak\" was tremendous. Finally a song that Patti's voice fits \u2026 as a duet with Bruce it was really something (although I think I was the only one listening). Finally, the last 4 songs of the set were really something: \"The Rising\" into \"Last to Die\" into \"Long Walk Home\" into \"Badlands\" was goosebumps time. Big time. Encores built slowly. No one knew \"Girls In Their Summer Clothes\" and virtually no one knew \"Thundercrack\" (although I have it on good authority that Chris \"Mad Dog\" Russo knew it), but as always \"Born to Run\" blew the roof off and we were home free.

All the oldies were done really well, and the crowd loved them. Re: Town Called Heartbreak, I like the song a lot on Patti's album, but it sounded kind of thin next to Bruce's material. It's his call whether to play it, or a 50's oldie, or whatever the hell he wants to do. This was the shortest E Street concert I've seen, only about 2:20. Yeah, a solo set before the encore would have added a lot, and the rest of the guys could have laid back for a bit. Finally, Magic is a classic.

His catalog of recorded work is immense. All of it superb. For Bruuuuuce to please everyone, he would have to ignore some lesser known songs which most would agree are masterpieces. I am sure that Bruce is tired of Thunder Road after 33 years of playing it. His new songs stand on their own. Last night I was at the Show in Hartford. I can tell those of you who were not there, that Radio Nowhere, Gypsy Biker, Last to Die and Devils Arcade fit nicely beside Badlands, Night and She's the One. Last night was a classic E-Street performance. I will never forget it. If I ever want to hear Prove It All Night and Thunder Road, which I love, I will spin up Live 1975-1985, or Live in NYC. As for Bruuuuucces current set list, I think he has given enough of his sweat and hard work to his fans over the years that he deserves to be able to pick his own songs. Thank you Bruuuuuuuce and E-Streeters, for a very enjoyable and meaningful night in Hartford last night. And Andrew, leave Patti Springsteen alone. Rock on Boss!!!!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Went expecting a little bit of a fall off and was pleasantly surprised as some of the changes from the Hartford show. Born to Run with all of the house lights on was certainly a highlight. Badlands moved to the end from its familiar 3 hole spot in previous tours seemed to provide a more intense rendition. I hope he never takes this one out of his shows. It's just too good live. At 44, I had my 15 and 12 year old along this time. It is amazing to see them \"enjoy\" almost all of the show, but really take ownership of the newer stuff from \"The Rising\", that came out when they were fans. They really \"lived\" or \"felt\" the music for these songs last night. Kind of the way I feel when he plays songs from Born to Run, Darkness and Born in the USA. Encore was very good, but I would have rather had sing along anthems to bop out the door to. Never heard American Land, but very good live. Kind of a Drop Kick Murphy/Flogging Molly sound. Always a gem in a bruce show\u2026 Thundercrack was it this time. All in all, the kind of show that makes me jealous that I'm not going back tonight.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Curt</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Awsome show last night in Philly! A downright eclectic set list. Highlights included a terrific version of Reason to Believe,a surprise No Surrender as second song, CANDIES ROOM for God sake!, PRomised Land (great as ever), Big MAn and Suzie jammin together at the end of Darlington County!!!. Then the encores: a big risk doing Girls in Their Summer Clothes - but he pulled it off and people loved it. Then launched into Thundercrack - NEVER thought I would hear a full band performance of that one! The \"lights on\" Born to Run as rockin as ever and Sunny Day, a real crowd pleaser. A rip roarin, two accordion attack in the Seeger American Land had the crowd hoppin and stompin! The new songs were great also with my person favorite being Long Walk Home. Near the end of the show where it should be and was performed with more passion by the entire band than probably any other. Almost forgot - did anyone else see Bruce toss his guitar to the back stage area toward end of She's the One - only to have it slam on the floor because no one was there to catch it?? Hysterical! There will be some disappointed with the emphasis on the new material and lack of Thunder Road, Jungleland, Rosalita and many other beloved classics. IT was still great Bruce, great E Street Band all rockin as hard as ever!!!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Donna</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">The show was great-opening set of four songs had the crowd instantly engaged. His new music is wonderful in a live setting and makes me want to go back and listen to the CD again. I was disappointed that the show was only 2 hours and 20 minutes. I hope this isn't all we can expect from the man that used to go four hours plus. I know we are all getting older but I always hoped Bruce would keep his never-ending energy level at his concerts. Don't know that a Bruce concert without ThunderRoad is acceptable to all of his diehard fans. He doesn't need to cut out any of his new material just add some more oldies.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Michael</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Going to this show I was struck by the fact that the first time I saw him was July 25, 1975, just eight shows before the legendary Bottom Line performances and a few weeks before the release of Born to Run. I vividly remember the chills I got watching perform his stories on stage while being chased around by the Big Man. It was also one of the first few shows after Little Steven (Miami Steve) came on board and the magic of watching a skinny bearded guy in a motorcycle jacket tell his tales to an adoring crowd that knew all the lyrics was spellbinding! I became a believer that night. Fast forward 32 plus years and many more live experiences, and last night was a treat. The surprise of \"No Surrender\" as a second song and then later a three-pack of \"Reason to Believe\" - \"Candy's Room\" - \"She's the One\" had my wife and I signing at the top of our lungs!!! Later in the set, Bruce gave us a four-pack of \"Promised Land\" - \"Brilliant Disguise\" - \"My Hometown\" - \"Darlington County\" and all my previous Springsteen shows came rushing back to me. The power and passion is still alive!! Lights out tonight\u2026 \"Badlands\", what a great way to end the set! I personally loved the mix of the on-core songs but would have loved to hear \"Incident\" because he seems to always play that in Philly. The show may have been a little short by Springsteen standards but the band, like all of us, has grown a little older but not lost that spirit in the night!!!!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Tom</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Well, the rock 'n' roll gods were by my side Friday night. Driving down the Turnpike without a ticket, I take a detour to avoid traffic and get lost \u2014 end up somewhere in Philly where they must have filmed the first Rocky movie. At 7:45, nowhere near the Wachovia center, I was ready to head home. But something guided me onward. Miraculously, I get there and park by 8:05. As I approach the main entrance a fellow has a ticket for section 116, which I purchase for $30. 2 minutes after I sit my butt down, the show starts, and what a show! Bruce and band were tight, fast and furious like a locomotive moving through the night. Great renditions of Reason to Believe, Candy's Room &amp; She's the One! The band was smoking along the tracks at this point with no sign of letting up. Livin in the Future &amp; Promised Lnd were equally good and Brilliant Disguise was a nice surprise, although I did want to hear Patti's song. Hometown &amp; Devil's Arcade just temporarily derailed the train. Bruce needs to work out that change in tempo from Promised Land and Darlington to those slow numbers. Adam Raised the Cain might work with Devil's Arcade, sins of our fathers and sins of our country\u2014maybe? Be nice to hear some Human Touch or Cover Me blast in after Radio Nowhere and the idea of needing to make that connection. From Last to Die up thru Badlands, the band was back on track and rolling like a monster. Unbelievable energy during those songs. Encores were great, especially Thundecrack and American Land. Sunny Day is ok, but would like to see Working on the Highway, Because the Night or Pink Caddy jump in those spots as well. Anyone dismissing this tour is foolish to do so because Bruce and band are \"proving it all night\"!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Philly Clete</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">The anticipation could not have been greater for me, after all, I had been waiting years to see Bruce and the band playing together again (this wasn't easy, and it took a toll on my family life. I'd like to publicly thank my loving wife and my two adorable girls for their support throughout). I was beside myself with excitement, trying to be a responsible, if not boring CPA all day that Friday. As I tell everyone who (pretends) to listen, \"Bruce NEVER disappoints\". And, of course, he didn't this time, either. This was a truly fun show. I was sitting with my brother-in-law, Matt, it was a 50th birthday celebration for him. Celebration is the perfect word, as Bruce was very playful. Bruce greeted the crowd by yelling, \"Is there anybody alive out there?\" Of course, this led into 'Radio Nowhere'. This is a really hard rocking song when performed live. It was the standard setlist, if there could be such a thing after only one official tour show! To Bruce's proud satisfaction, much of the crowd knew his new material (The record had been released only three days before the show). After the first chorus sing-a-long of 'Girls In Their Summer Clothes' Bruce commented, \"Ya\" almost got it! It seemed as though half the crowd must have had the CD in advance (don't blame me)! In all, eight tracks from the new CD were performed. The shows have a few multi-song sequences every night. The first is a three-pack, with 'Radio Nowhere', an optional song ('No Surrender' tonight - or - 'The Ties That Bind' - or -'Night') followed by 'Lonesome Day'. Little Steven fans will love 'Gypsy Biker'. Steve is awesome on his extended solo. This is a really powerful live song. Definitely Steve's performance highlight. Bruce's intro to 'Magic' included comments that we seem to be in an \"Orwellian\" time right now. He said that things that are true are being passed off as lies, and lies are being passed off as being true (paraphrasing here). He said that the song wasn't really about magic, but rather about tricks. After Magic comes a smoking power three-pack. The first is 'Reason To Believe', then usually either 'Candy's Room' (tonight) or 'Adam Raised A Cain'. The third is 'She's The One', a compressed, super-charged version. I had studied up a bit before the show (an understatement?) so I was curious what the 'ZZ Top' version of 'Reason To Believe' would be like. It was a very cool rockin' adaptation (despite the dreaded \"bullet mic\" - limited use only). The crowd immediately reacted and stayed with it throughout. This was a real highlight for me. Before 'Livin' In The Future' Bruce did another political rap, very similar to what he said on the Today Show. Possibly in an effort to soften the tone, he said that \"Tonight we're gonna do something about it - We're gonna sing about it!' For me, this song was a little disappointing live. I had envisioned a really fun, rollicking song - 'Waiting On A Sunny Day' immediately came to mind when I first heard it on the cd. Maybe it was the political nature of the message that held it back for me. After 'The Promised Land', a nightly staple for this tour, comes a \"Patti\" song. In the past it was 'Town Called Heartbreak' from her new CD. Tonight it was 'Brilliant Disguise', never one of my Bruce faves. That led into 'My Hometown', another one of my \"non-faves\". Even more disappointing to me was that the handwritten setlist had 'Adam Raised A Cain' in this slot! Oh well, I know that once it appears on Bruce's handwritten setlist it shows up somewhere down the line. Next up was 'Darlington County', which was very fun. The crowd was getting back in the groove after the two-song \"lull\". The next five-pack has been intact every night. It conveys the core of Bruce's message for the evening. We hear 'Devil's Arcade', 'The Rising', 'Last To Die', 'Long Walk Home' and 'Badlands'. 'Devil's Arcade' was true to the CD version - soft musical intro leading into the song. This was a bathroom song this night (maybe because they didn't perform 'Town'). A real high point for me was 'Long Walk Home'. I think that the band has this one nailed already. The melody is great - it is easy to sing along with the chorus. The arrangement is beautiful, as it keeps building and building. Clarence has a very nice solo, too. I loved this. The main set ended with 'Badlands'. You can't do any better than that. Enough said. The first encore was 'Girls In Their Summer Clothes' after Bruce's local donation plug. Amazingly, I noticed that the setlist showed 'Racing' in this spot. I must say that this is the other 'Magic' song that I had expected to enjoy more when played live. Not sure why? Without question, the song that I was looking forward to the most out of every song that I saw from the prior setlists (Hartford plus the rehearsal shows) was the full-band version of 'Thundercrack' (Bruce magnificently premiered this at the Spectrum solo Devils and Dust show). Tonight he mentioned that the song is older than the Liberty Bell, and that the song is what put the crack in the bell. It was cool, delirious, playful, exciting, nostalgic, and EXCELLENT. The crowd immediately jumped in at the first note, and sung along in all the right spots. Bruce actually looked impressed (Reports said that the Hartford crowd seemed to not be aware of the song). From there it was house lights on for 'Born To Run', followed by 'Waiting On A Sunny Day' The finale was an Irish jig of a song called 'American Land'. Bruce wrote this song during his tour with the Sessions Band and began performing it with them. He also released a second version of the Seeger Sessions CD, called the American Land Edition to include it. I think that it is a great show closer. This show was more fun than intense, and it had many, many highlights. It was Philadelphia, so the crowd was terrific as always. What a great show and a great start to my adventure.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I thought Saturday's show had more sustained energy because of better song selection and and the order of material. Paying was better and kept the audience on its feet through entire show with the exception of the slower numbers. As with any Springsteen performance on his last night in Philly, he threw in some surprises, the biggest being Incident on 57th Street during the middle of the show!! The show started stronger when they blasted in to Night as the opening number, followed by Radio Nowhere and then Prove It All Night!! This 1,2,3 punch set the tone for the rest of the evening. He followed his hard rockin' version of Reason to Believe with Ties that Bind, a number I haven't heard him do in awhile - crowd loved it! Cadillac Ranch almost blew the roof off the Wachovia Center! As with Friday night, I think the best performance of his new material was with Long Walk Home, a song that builds in intensity and is performed with passion by the entire band. Promised Land and Badlands provided the inspiration and sense of revival that you can only get with a Bruce show. Girls in Summer Clothes I think will be a BIG hit for him, grows on me every time I hear it. A big highlight was Clarence, Nils, Bruce and Suzie jammin' hard together during Thundercrack. After Born to Run, kept the lights on and spiced up the encore with the hard rocking version of Dancing in the Dark. Finished again with the stompin' American Land that got the crowd in a frenzy. A GREAT weekend of Bruce and the E Street Band! Oh, Clarence's little hat adjustments right before his sax solos are a great touch too!!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Dave</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">If having to listen to a sneaked-in Patti song will get you incident on 57th street, then it's all worth it.

And this was a good night to be in Philadelphia. I can't believe they are this solid this soon. The classic songs were killer, the gems pulled out of the bag were beyond words, and the new songs were'the new songs. You can tell he gave much thought to the pacing of the set list, knowing that to (us!) the crowd, the Magic entries could not stand up against the classics, but they could stand with them if you put them in the right place. He kind of eased us down to them, time and again. Other notes on the setlist - there was not a lot of talking, going tightly from song to song. No stories; a quick band intro at the end. There were a couple of quick politico comments, but not much. A special theme ran through the classics - lots of saxophone-heavy songs, as well as a big helping of harmonica. The big man, looking good, got a workout. I walked in wary, mindful of the start of The Rising Tour - which didn't get off to a great start with only 22 songs (11 from The Rising album - ugh) and very few if any changes during the first few shows. But then, suddenly and without warning - At 8:25 large \"calliope\" at least I think that's what it's called - rises from the back of the stage - as the lights go down. The calliope is churning out the melody of the Seeger Session tune. Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze (what is the Boss trying to tell us?) as the band mates take their places on the dark dark stage. As we psycopg.Cursorthe opening of Radio No No! Still in the dark, we get the JACK HAMMER/MACHINE GUN opening of ?Night??then the blaring SAX as the stage is lit - and IT'S ON.<br/>\n1. NIGHT. Bedlam. The energy meter is already in the red. Then - \"Is there anybody alive out there?! Is there anybody REALLY alive out there!?!?!?\"<br/>\n2. RADIO NOWHERE. This radio has POW-ER. Then - One. Two. One Two Three Four.<br/>\n3. The hammer drops on PROVE IT ALL NIGHT. As good as you've ever heard it. After those three, what's next? The Band and the Boss were feeling the love from the beginning, and giving it right back. The man once said \"This is Philly. We expect excellence\". Neither side was letting the other down at this point. After that, a series of energy highs and lows. As I said, you can tell he puts a lot of thought into the pacing, and the roller coaster ride he takes us on.<br/>\n4 &amp; 5. GYPSY BIKER and MAGIC. The new songs are good, but they are not balls to the wall, and they don't stand much of a chance against the first three. My very untrained ear still heard what I can best call a - different voice, a softer one used for all of the Magic songs sung after RN. But - we're only slowing down before we pick back up. Before MAGIC, he says, in reference to the White House, the song is not really about magic - it's about \"tricks\".<br/>\n6, 7 &amp; 8. He takes us back to the top of the mountain. Another incredible hat-trick. REASON TO BELIEVE. I had read from the earlier reviews that this was the highlight of the show, and - this was the highlight of the show (at least until a certain Incident). It was reworked with lots of blues, lots of harmonica. Ya gotta hear it. From there, we were off to the 80's (TIES) and then back to the 70's (SHE'S THE ONE) - and these three were almost as strong as the first three. So far - WOW.<br/>\n9 &amp; 10. LIVING IN THE FUTURE. He liked singing this one. Catchy tune, strong message, and he walked right up to the camera and stuck his face in it to make certain points (\"My faith's been TORN asunder\"), as if he was on a direct feed to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The Sha Na Na Na's at the end of the song eased into the harmonica opening of a VERY strong rendition of Promised Land. OK, take a breath. TOWN CALLED HEARTBREAK. Well, I was taught that if you don't have anything good to say - it was the first time I heard it, and I've read since that it was a new and improved version but - I like Patti, but nothing by or about her is made for the front of the stage. Sorry. But - we go right from the bottom to the gentle top of the show - Incident on 57th St. This was a true diamond for us. And they played it and he sang like they do it every night. Ahh- those Romantic Young Boys! And then- as if that weren't enough - a pause on stage before the next song - looked like an audible, but I'm not sure and I don't care. Just when you were at the highest point, you're going higher to the electric start of CADILLAC RANCH. As the great New York philosopher once said: Holy Cow! From there - where do you go from there? One shortcoming. I expected THE LAST TO DIE to be stronger, much like RN, but it was held back, especially with that 'Magic' voice. BADLANDS was on the money, but not the epic version of the Reunion Tour, BUT STILL THE MOST FEROCIOUS LIVE SONG EVER. It closes the set. The encores were strong, building from the melodic but bittersweet SUMMER CLOTHES through a long THUNDERCRACK (they were having fun up there!) into lights on for B2R. A rocking DANCING IN THE DARK picked up where it left off at the end of the Reunion Tour (\"Heyyyy Baaaybeee\") and the show closed with the #1 Seeger Song (although I thing Bruce wrote most of this one) AMERCIAN LAND. I think, with this song, he is tossing a \"Thanks\" to those who are fans of all his endeavors. Whew. 10:40 Of course, we waited, arrogant enough to think that he will do one more for Philly - maybe the next time around? Wow - sorry this was so long, but I was trying to give you an idea of what you have to look forward to. This tour was worth the wait.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Lisa</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">OH MY GOD!!

A pre-show Bruce tailgate was imperative. Everything was aligned for a special show. It was just that. Being a seasoned Bruce veteran, I told my fellow tailgaters to look for a \"bonus song\" before 'Radio Nowhere'. A bonus song at the beginning of the show is a sign of what is to follow. Bruce opened the show with 'Night', a \"bonus\" song before 'Radio Nowhere'. Not only was I feeling a bit psychic, but I was ecstatic. After all, this was Philly, this was night #2 after a \"standard\" setlist, and we had just heard a \"bonus\" opening song - wow! In all, Bruce paid SEVEN different songs from the night before! 'Prove It All Night' came after 'Radio'. Wildness ensued in the crowd. 'Reason To Believe' continued to shine, with the crowd into it even more than at Philly night #1. After 'The Promised Land', Patti headlined 'Town Called Heartbreak'. I really enjoyed this song (a very nice arrangement showcasing Danny on the organ). I might be in the minority. An automatic bathroom song, only the speedy wipers returned in time for the beginning of 'Incident'. Always a Philly favorite, it was beautiful. The band nailed it. I think that Bruce must have appreciated the audience response to 'Incident', so he audibled 'Cadillac Ranch'. My daughter, Holly, who has been wishing to see this performed live for years, finally got her wish. It was rollicking, raucous, messy, and GREAT. At one point, Bruce announced a solo from Steve, who was not prepared. He quickly ramped up to speed, and the party song continued. As the band was beginning the chorus in the middle of the song, Bruce said \"Let the people do it\" - and we did. Huge highlight - Bruce had everyone up and dancing. BTW: the setlist had 'Sunny Day' in this spot. This show was both intense and fun - Philly shows are nothing if not fun. Bruce is always so relaxed here, and it shows. Tonight, when Bruce broke into 'Thundercrack', the crowd went even more nuts than night one. Singing, chanting, dancing in the crowd everywhere you looked. At one point during the song, while Bruce and the audience were trading \"all night\" chants, someone hit a stray guitar note. Bruce made the most of it by yelling \"who did that?\" - and looking at each band member. I'm not sure who it was. In the middle (if there is a middle to this song) Bruce, Nils and Suzie were at stage front jamming for an eternity. By this point the crowd had been worked into a frenzy (I checked the YouTube video to confirm this). The frenzy never stopped until the show ended - it was so great to be a part of the experience. At the end of the song Bruce simply said, \"Thanks, Philly\" After 'Born To Run', with house light still on came the rocking version of 'Dancing In The Dark', replacing 'Sunny' from the prior night. This was a great switch, as it kept the frenzy going. 'American Land' finished the show. The crowd energy never stopped, even though the majority of concertgoers had never heard this song before. A fabulous show filled with highlights and special \"Philly\" trademarks. As I ALWAYS say, I am so lucky to be from Philadelphia, home of Bruce Springsteen's greatest shows.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

The only exception for me was 'Darkness' after 'Promised Land'. The story wasn't what was played, but rather what wasn't played. All night, my daughter Danielle and I had been noting the obvious lack of intensity of the crowd. I didn't expect the Jersey crowd to match that of Philly, but this was really disappointing. Bruce and the band were really on tonight, but it was not being properly appreciated. The arena sound quality was not very good, which made it difficult to understand Bruce's spoken comments. After 'Promised Land', Bruce was ready to get into the next song. He kept looking back at Roy. He was making comments such as, \"are you ready, Roy? - do you have it, Roy?\" etc. Finally, he said, \"alright, we'll get back to that and we'll do this one, first\". He then played 'Darkness', 'Brilliant Disguise' and 'Darlington County'. Upon review, the setlist showed 'Town Called Heartbreak', 'Incident' or 'Backstreets', and then 'You Can Look, But You Better Not Touch'. Wow - what a missed opportunity! During the sing-a-long in 'Girls In Their Summer Clothes', Bruce commented to the crowd \"Philly was much louder than this!\" - so true. 'Thundercrack' received a lackluster response at best, which was performed so well once again. The band's performance was really strong this night, but since the crowd factor becomes a part of every show, this one was nowhere near the top.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Sal M.</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">The set list was a great mix of the new with the classics. The band blew the roof off the place. I was impressed by have many people in the audience could sing along to \"Girls in Their Summer Clothes\" because the CD's only been out a week. But we were all disappointed when the show ended at about 10:30; they played for less than two and a half hours. It was the shortest show I've seen in the thirty years I've been going.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Stacey</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">I'll start w/the good\u2026 Bruce still knows how to rock and put on a show. He'll never let you down. Band looked great - seemed in giddy spirits. Song selection was very similar to night #1 in Philly with the exception of 2 songs, so there were really no surprises. He did play a nice selection from Darkness and the new music sounds really good live. He threw in an audible but someone (Roy or Max, not sure) couldn't get it right so Bruce said they'd get back to it. I think the audible ended up being Brilliant Disguise. Of course I was hoping for an audible in a much more rare form. Bad\u2026 the acoustics were awful. It was so incredibly loud and everything just sounded a bit muffled and echoey. My ears still hurt and after seeing tons of Bruce concerts, I don't ever recall the sound being so poor. Crowd - VERY DISSAPOINTING. Come on Jersey - what's up? They just didn't seem all that into it - not too loud (or maybe the acoustics were drowning everyone out) and no sustained Bruuuuuuuuuce's or cheering that was to my liking. In fact, when Bruce broke out Thundercrack (my personal highlight), he said - Hey, Philly was louder than you guys! I'm sure they were b/c I think about 15 people knew the song. Sigh\u2026 All in all, a great show, b/c he is the Boss and doesn't know how to put on a bad one. Going again tomorrow night and I can only hope he shakes it up a bit like he did for Philly night 2.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">T.C.</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Solid show from start to finish. It was good to reunite with fellow Bruce enthusiast, Kyle. After a good half hour haggling with people selling tks, we got in 10 minutes before the show for $20. Bruce and band were on fire! Very passionate performance, especially No Surrender, Candy's Room, &amp; She's the One just set the place ablaze! Reason to Believe, done down and bluesy is terrific. Darkness and Brilliant Disguise were nailed perfectly. Where's Backstreets or Price You Pay? Hopefully soon. Long Walk Home is turning into one of my favorite songs of the night \u2014 great imagery and a great message. Encore time was just a blast. From Thundercrack, Born to Run, Dancing in the Dark and a furious American Land, you can't help but walk out high \u2014 so high from the show. The band is sounding tighter, more powerful and confident than on the reunion tour. This version of She's the One is one of the best the band has ever performed! I guess being an aging rock star doesn't mean you have to fade away and go out quietly. And Bruce and band are a testament to that!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Steve</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">I thought the show was great. The band seemed really tight and everything sounded really good. I was really impressed with the new music - Long Walk Home sounds like a classic to me. I was disappointed they only played for 2:10, but it was a solid 2:10 for sure. Funny spot of the night: the audience heard the first few bars of Living in the Future and jumped up, thinking he was playing 10th Ave Freeze Out. They seemed a little surprised as it turned out to be something new!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I saw a whole bunch of old songs played that I had never seen Bruce play before, or if I did I didn't get them at the shows I went to on The Rising Tour, and hadn't seen them played since the Reunion Tour. The new version of Reason To Believe was amazing. At first I was kind of confused, and thought Bruce was going to waste a song slot on a cover song with that new intro, but then the lyrics to Reason To Believe started. I thought Candy's Room or Ties That Bind would be next, but to my shock, it was Adam Raised A Cain, which I had never seen played before. As if that wasn't shock enough, later, we got INCIDENT ON 57TH STREET! I never thought I'd see this one played. To be honest, it actually was played a little too slow, but I didn't really care at the time because I was so glad to finally be seeing that song played. The new songs were great. Gypsy Biker I liked better live than on the album. It rocked more live. We also got a surprise with Your Own Worst Enemy making its debut. Badlands seemed to rock harder than I've ever seen it played before. And then of course the encores, with Born To Run and Dancing In The Dark with the houselights on was great. I was worried as it was getting later in the show that we would get no 80's hits, so I was glad that we got at least one at the end. And then American Land was a great set closer. Can't wait for MSG next week.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Philly Clete</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">What a difference a day can make. Bruce was definitely hot during NJ night #1, but he was sizzling tonight. He was not to be denied there could be no weak response from the crowd. At the start of the show he said, \"Let's hear it, homies\" a few times. The crowd did respond, and they were much better than at night #1. Also, for some reason (my seat location ) the arena sound was much improved from night #1. This was a longer show than the previous three, at 25 supercharged songs, including four tour premieres. A total of SEVEN songs not heard the night before. The band was \"dead on\" tonight, and Bruce seemed ferocious in his delivery of some of the music (the tour premiere of 'Adam Raised A Cain', for one). After 'Promised Land' Bruce dusted off 'Cynthia' as an audible. It was a lot of fun. At one point, Bruce called Steve over to share his mike. It became obvious that Steve didn't remember the words to this one, and he was trying to bluff it. Steve tried peeking down at Bruce's teleprompter, but he lost it again. They both cracked up as Steve went back to his spot. After 'Town' came 'Incident', which, although beautiful, did not elicit anywhere near the same reaction as it did in Philly (After seeing the previous night's handwritten setlist I was hoping for 'Backstreets', since I had seen 'Incident' in Philly.) Then came a world premiere - Bruce and the gang were buzzing back and forth in the dark for the longest time. \"Wait a minute, let's try it\". He told the crowd that \"we're having a debate society up here, inside my head\". \"Okay, never before attempted\". He stopped the crowd from cheering by saying, \"Wait, ya gotta wait and see\". Then, after a shaky start, 'Your Own Worst Enemy' was performed for the first time, with Bruce in fine voice. At the end of the song Bruce said with a big laugh, \"That's close\". Next, Bruce said, \"Steve, get that electric guitar!\" and they mugged it up (including Clarence) with a superfun 'You Can Look But You Better Not Touch'. This was a superb triple-shot, and it made the show for me. Even the 'Girls' sing-along was much better than the previous night, with Bruce proudly commenting \"Ya got it now!\" It seems that 'Thundercrack' does not get a huge response outside of Philly even though it is such great fun. This show was as good as it gets - intense, fun, diverse. This one was right at the top of list.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Stacey</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Thank you fans for redeaming yourselves from the 10/9 show.

Also, not sure if anyone from the Springsteen camp reads any of these, but just wanted to say THANKS! For playing a heartfelt rendition of Incident on 57th Street. Lyrically, that has to be one of Bruce's most poetic songs and it was a real treat to hear it Wednesday night. Keep it in the show because it is one that is loved by many.<br/>\nOkay, the show: Well, after being lucky enough to score 2 tks in sec 110 half an hour before the show, fellow Springsteen nut, Kyle and I head to our seats. Bruce was on a mission from the start and after having witnessed many shows at the arena, this was hands down one of the most passionate, explosive, energetic shows ever. It ranks in my top 15 of roughly 135 shows. Radio Nowhere was powerful and Night just exploded on stage. Was hoping for Prove it or even Cover Me as a third selection. I like Magic. A powerfully, quiet song with disturbing imagery. Reason to Believe is just a moment of raw, bluesy, rock 'n' roll at its best \u2014 love it! Adam Raised the Cain was passionately intense and a great selection. The content of the song fits in perfectly with the overall theme of the first half of the show. She's the One \u2014 they've never done a better version! It rocks! Livin in the Future is growing on me. Cynthia was an unexpected treat and played beautifully. Town called Heartbreak, I like it. Incident! I've already raved about this one \u2014 a great song that just elevates the entire night to another level when something of this quality is played with such passion and sincerity. You can Look was a blast! Fun time had by all on this one. I'm not that into Devil's Arcade, but feel it might even be more powerful coupled with Born in the USA right after it, or, if Bruce felt like tossing in a cover tune, Fortunate Son. Perhaps alternate Rising with USA. Long Walk Home is definitely my favorite of the new material and Badlands just blows the roof off of anywhere they play. Glad he's playing Born to Run and the rockin' version of Dancing, a great double shot which works much better than Sunny Day. And American Land \u2014 it's just a great way, an upbeat way to end the show. Bruce and band I think set a standard by which many other bands should measure themselves. They rock hard! They are not an oldies act! They play with a passion and intensity that should make rockers half their age envious. Their integrity to always give their best and go that extra mile every night is a testament to the fact that they love what they are doing and, we, as fans, should be as appreciative that Bruce and band are still giving us the best rock 'n' roll show around without a doubt! It's a great feeling to be back in the Church of Bruce and feel that salvation is there in \"an everlasting kiss\" and something as simple as a rock 'n' roll song. Amen!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Always interesting to experience shows early on in the tour with its intense, work-in-progress character with Bruce often still defining the setlist, as compared to the ones towards its end where more musical surprises pop up but the original theme gets ever more watered down. The difference between North American and European audiences also seem to affect the tone of the concerts, with more immediate reactions and sing-alongs in NA but often more appreciative and enthusiastic crowds in Europe. It's a trade-off! Got to enjoy an amazing RtB from the edge of the pit and the first-ever State Trooper since 85 (from where I was standing everybody seemed to recognize Winn and Regine right of the bat and although I'd never heard of them, enjoyed their contribution). This was a real treat which I was lucky enough to have repeated in Hamburg next year with the second ever Held Up Without\u2026.

The audience was much livelier before the start than it had been in Ottowa, the place was full and so much noisier throughout. Bruce, as always, picked up the energy from the crowd and seemed to be having more fun because of it. I was almost dumbstruck when he intro'd For You - \"A request, for Ed..\" and it was simply wonderful. But then we got Incident and later Thundercrack. Absolute gems, all three. The Rising into Last to Die is a super pairing. I really like Long Walk Home too. But it has a quiet start and then builds and builds so a lot of people who obviously don't know the new album sat down. More fool them. If you want to understand how powerful the new songs are live just think of a blistering version of Candy's Room. They all measure up, in my book. I'm not sure when it happened (either towards the end of the main set or after Girls) but I noticed one of the crew replacing one of the playlists. The noise was so loud I really thought there was a chance we'd get another song in the encores or even after American Land. Sadly, it was not to be. This was a brilliant show, fast, furious, aggressive at times, but the inclusion of For You and Incident made it poignant and reflective too.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I've seen him in the NJ/NYC/Philly area in concert 20 times since 1999, and never saw anything off that album played. After Promised Land, I knew it was time for the spot in the show where he sometimes is playing Brilliant Disguise this tour. I sat there on the edge of my seat, hoping for it, and then finally, the opening drums to it started, and the crowd right away started cheering. That song was the highlight of the whole show for me. But also, I had only seen The Ties That Bind played once before on the Reunion Tour, so it was great to see that one again, and I haven't seen Backstreets played much, so I was glad to get that one. The crowd in my section was more into Adam Raised A Cain than the people near me in NJ night 2 last week, doing the fist pumping and yelling \"YEAH!\" in between Bruce singing \"Raised a cain!\".</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Philly Clete</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Being a much older arena than most, the \"Garden\" seems smaller than today's joints. This is a great advantage for a concertgoer. We were sitting up near the ceiling, but we had a great sight line and still felt like we were \"in the mix\". Also, the sound was excellent. This show reminded me of the Philly night #1 - an excellent, fun show full of warm energy. This being night #1 of 2 it was a standard setlist. The highlights for me included a wonderful 'Backstreets' and a scorching 'Adam'/ 'She's The One' double-shot. As Bruce has done many times in the past, he felt the need to exacerbate the NY v. NJ rivalry. During the 'Livin In The Future' intro he mentioned some of the things we love about New York. He mentioned the Statue of Liberty \"which is technically located in NJ\". He mentioned the NY Giants and the NY Jets \"who happen to play their home games in NJ\". He mentioned that wonderful anthem 'New York, New York' - which, of course, was sung by someone from NJ. I am always on board for any NY bashing. Even though I haven't mentioned it repeatedly, I think that 'Long Walk Home' is stellar night in and night out. One (or a few) sour note(s) - during 'Girls' Clarence seemed way off key during his solo. Bruce walked over to him while he was playing and he exhorted 'C'mon C!' in more of a stern than playful manner (at least that is what it looked like to me on the screen, which caught the exchange). At the end of 'Girls', Bruce commented, \"I wish they all could be New York City girls\", alluding to the Beach Boys influence on this song. Bruce's intro to 'Thundercrack' mentioned that it was the band's closer during the days when they played Max's Kansas City, a tiny club in NYC. \"It was us and the Wailers on the bill\". Tonight's was the best 'Thundercrack' performance. During 'American Land' they were trying to get the lyrics onto the screens, but only managed one line. Great, great show in the Big Apple.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Came on stage screaming \"New York City!!!, Is there anyone alive tonight!!!\" and the gauntlet was thrown down. A blistering version of Night in the second spot following Radio Nowhere. Nils had an amazing slide solo in Lonesome Day. A bluesy roadhouse version of Reason to Believe with the Boss singing the last verse into a bullet mic. The strong driving beat of Candy's Room (let them burn!)with a searing solo by Steve moved seamlessly into She's the One. The show stopper was Bruce dedicating a song to the late Peter Boyle who would have been celebrating his 72nd birthday that night. What followed was Roy on piano and Gary on upright bass accompanying Bruce singing the rarely played Meeting Across the River. I don't know if anyone else caught it but \"2 grand\" turned into \"3 grand\" after 32 years, but I guess everything costs more today that in the mid 70's. As the song was ending, Bruce points back to Suzie and a violin solo begins\u2026 JUNGLELAND!!! WOW!!!! All of MSG was singing along including many in attendance in Ranger jerseys! Great version of You Can Look (But U Better Not Touch) with fun banter with Steve. New York City Pride in the Rising was clearly evident. My personal favorite off Magic, Long Walk Home just gets better every time I hear it and a fabulous set ender\u2026 Badlands, with the arena serenading them off and back on the stage. Came back in a black New York City t-shirt to the delight of everyone! Nice intro to Thundercrack in which Bruce described it as the original show stopper when there was nobody at the show to stop at Max's Kansas City with Bob Marley &amp; Wailers. All the lights were on for Born to Run and the American Land final with the Seeger Sessions band joining E Street on stage. I couldn't have asked for a better way to celebrate my 49th birthday. Bruce does an masterful job of blending songs from his vast catalog into a fabulous show.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Philly Clete</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Bruce was on a mission. Tonight's show was a perfect mix of ferocious power and kidlike fun. There were two tour premieres and SIX songs not played at night #1! I must mention again that the three-pack of 'Reason', 'Candy's Room' and 'She's the One' are sizzlers. Bruce did a shortened version of his NY v. NJ shtick while introducing 'Livin' (see October 17 review). The 'Patti song' tonight was 'Tougher Than The Rest', which Bruce and Patti performed with great intensity. I couldn't wait to hear what was coming in the bonus slot after 'the Patti song', even though I knew what it would be. In fact, I told a stranger this in the men's room after night #1, and I told a fellow Bruce nut that was sitting in front of me this night. 'We are in NYC, he did 'Backstreets' last night ' tonight is 'Jungleland' - I confidently predicted. Forgive my brashness, but I do know Bruce. Bruce introduced the next song by dedicating it to Peter Boyle, a friend of his who passed away recently. As soon as I heard the beginning strains of 'Meeting Across The River' I knew that my prediction/wish was coming true. My Bruce friend and I high-fived with anticipation, while enjoying this terrific performance of 'Meeting'. Just as on the album, 'Meeting' gently flowed right into 'Jungleland'. It was simply magnificent. Clarence nailed the haunting solo, and Bruce walked over to him, with the smile of a proud father, as he gave him a tap on the shoulder (I think that Bruce could have been worried about the solo - have you ever seen him smile during Jungleland'). This was the tour highlight for me. Next came a 180 degree switch in moods as 'You Can Look' was played. When Bruce came back after the 'Badlands' main set closer he was wearing a black T-Shirt with 'New York City' on the front in white lettering (a bit schmaltzy, but go for it). Again, the nice introduction to 'Thundercrack', saying that it was the band's show stopper 'before there was a show to stop'. He mentioned that they played it at Max's Kansas City 'which held about 150 people' \u2026 and there were empty seats!' Have I mentioned recently that I love 'Thundercrack'. Five members of the Sessions Band came out to play on 'American Land', which was extra rousing tonight. Also, the technicians got their act together and all of the words to the song were superimposed on the screens with arrows to follow along. I thought that was a neat touch, and I was now able to sing along with the gang. Some interesting (to me, anyway) changes from the handwritten setlist. The following songs were listed but not performed: 'Town Called Heartbreak', 'Cadillac Ranch', and 'Ramrod' (listed in the encore instead of 'Thundercrack'!). The following songs from the show were not on the setlist: 'Tougher Than The Rest', 'Meeting Across The River', You Can Look', and 'Thundercrack'. I loved this show, and I think that it was the best of the six shows that I have seen (2 Philly, 2 NJ and 2 NYC). I wish could get to Boston!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">TC</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">A solid show from start to finish. The song selection has helped in greatly improving the flow and overall intensity of the evening. I like the songs Bruce has selected to be rotated in the opening, but I also feel Human Touch and Hard to be a Saint would also add a nice kick to the opening set, as Bruce focuses on connections made, lost and regained. Reason, Candy's Room and She's the One are played with such an intensity that, to listen to the band and Bruce, you would think they were all 10-15 years younger as they rip through those songs. She's the One hopefully will stay in the set when they return next summer. Tougher than the Rest was a nice surprise and I hope Bruce plays more from the Tunnel collection: Tunnel of Love, One Step Up and Spare Parts. Meeting glided smoothly into Jungleland, which was simply breathtaking. \"They wind up wounded, not even dead\" is such a powerful line and Jungleland simply has to be one of the most amazing songs ever written. The images and story conjure up an early Marlon Brando film, The Fugitive Kind, wherein the young, innocent, rebel is destroyed by forces beyond his control because the world around him cannot accept his existence, cannot accept that he is in fact different and may in fact be more free in his dream than they will ever be \u2014 powerful storytelling at its best! I like the message and intensity of the Rising, Last to Die, Long Walk Home and Badlands \u2014 probably one of the best mini-sets Bruce has put together, but I was also thinking that the same message and theme can be continued if The Rising were rotated with Cover Me, Further on Up the Road, Born in the USA and even Lost in the Flood. Long Walk Home has become one of my favorite songs of the evening! The encores are simply a lot of fun. The threesome of Born to Run, Dancing and American Land just leave you with such a high as you exit the show, realizing you have just witnessed something truly amazing and not duplicated by many other bands. Hoping Stolen Car and Drive all Night are not too far from making their debut into the shows. Great show and thanks, Kyle, fellow Bruce enthusiast, for sharing the ride from the Jersey side.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

The sound was crystal clear in the United Center, the crowd on this night was way more excited than the night before, and Bruce responded in kind. Radio Nowhere blasted out the gate, then Prove It All Night and Lonesome Day\u2026 good start\u2026 some new stuff came next, and the crowd loved 'em: Gypsy Biker and Magic. Both are very cool live. Then this new ZZ Top style of Reason To Believe, and the crowd goes absolutely nuts!!!! Now Bruce and the rest are feeling it. No time to catch our breath as they pour out Candy's Room (Insane), She's the One (Max!) and Living in the Future, followed by Promised Land, Spirit in the Night and Darlington County, all of which had bursts of the house lights and we could clearly see all 18,000 people on their feet and jamming. Incredible sight. Now Bruce has a friendly chat with the crowd, talks a little politics and leads into Devil's Arcade, Rising, Last to Die (Very cool as well), and Long Walk Home which is an emotional charge deep into the soul at such high volume. Next we hear the crisp piano noted to start Badlands and the roof flies off the building. The only person not jumping out of their shoes was Max! I almost passed out from the adrenaline rush. Bruce then starts to talk about Thundercrack, and is interrupted by the kid that drew the lucky number for the pit passes, and says something about the younger fans haven't heard this one, so what the heck. He then changes guitars and fires into the harmonica the opening rip for Thunder Road! Again the place explodes! Then we get Born to Run, Dancing in the Dark and finally American Land. Holy ! I've seen 18 shows since 1984, and this was it.

The quantity, i.e., length, of a show is a poor measure of it's quality. From the moment the lights went down this show was so very very intense. From 2/3s back in the pit, the sound was perfect. LOUD and Clear. Bruce was on fire.<br/>\nI've never seen harder rock n' roll by anyone, ever, not the Rolling Stones, The Who, Neil Young, REM, John Fogerty, the Clash, Tom Petty, the Kinks, Aerosmith, Kiss, Elton John, ZZ Top, a dozen other world class rockers, or Bruce Springsteen rock with more sustained intensity.<br/>\nThe Magic songs sound much richer (and louder) live, and fit seamlessly with the hits, and some greats that were probably unknown to casual fans.<br/>\nThe final four, before the encore trace what has happened to our nation between 9/11 and now. 1) The Rising is about disaster and hope; 2) The Last to Die is an unsubtle critique of the folly of the war in Iraq, which to justify, Bush/Chaney turned a lie into the truth, and the truth into a lie - they cut us in half while we were smiling ear to ear; 3) Long Walk Home, IMO, the strongest song on Magic and Bruce's best rocker since Land of Hope and Dreams, is about the tragic changes enacted in our name by the people who have stolen two elections and hijacked our government, changes that have made us a lessor people.<br/>\nTorture, locking people up for any reason whatsoever, for no reason - how would we know, the government won't even tell those in prison what crimes they are alledged to have committed. Are they guilty of anything? Who knows because the evidence, if any, is secret. Pure McCathyism at its worst. An unknown number of prisoners, but at least 32, have died while in our custody. Waterboarding deaths? Deaths from tazers used on any of a males eleven appendises, sleep depravation, isolation in hypothermia temperatures in their underwear for 24 or 48 hours, with periodic hose downs, ear splitting music 24 hours a day one two three days? Who knows, for \"national security\" reasons the Bush/Chaney cabal won't even reveal the location of the secret prisons where those rounded up in 2003, and hundreds, perhaps thousands more, have been tortured - oh, duh, if they told us, they wouldn't be secret.<br/>\nFour thousand dead American Soldiers - which one will be the last to die? Will it the 5,000th? Seven, ten? - another 30,000 with serious injuries such as the loss of one or more limbs, eye sight, or permanent mental impairment. We don't count 'em but there are at least 100,000 innocent dead Iraqis, and we have caused another 2 to 3 million already impoverished Iraqis to now also be homeless; The moral high ground Bruce rights of in The Rising, is long gone on Long Walk Home.<br/>\nThe cost in dollars of the war in Iraq? Before the invasion a lie was made to appear to be the truth: \"It won't cost a penny because it will all be paid for with Iraqi oil\". Now the truth is made a lie: There is no line item for the war in the federal government budget. Maybe it is free. Or maybe it's: 1) buried in the military budget - 460 billion a year, more than the rest of the world combined, and going up about 12-15% annually, and: 2) 50, or so, billion every six months is \"supplemental\". Total cost: Bush says 1.1 Trillion, with a T. Other estimates: 1.8 trillion. Oh yeah, for sure. Paid for with Iraqi oil.<br/>\nEstimates are that between 15 and 25% of that money is waste. Accidental over-payments; outright fraud such as that Haliburton is skilled at committing, incompetence, complexities of changing needs as the military objectives change, typical cost overruns, a billion tossed to Blackwater to pay mercenary, cowboy thugs $1,250 a day, and they are paid every day, seven days a week, whether they leave the green zone or not. They make more in a month than a typical American soldier makes in an entire 15 month tour. Seems fair. Those Blackwater boys deserve $456,000 for a year in Iraq, courtesy of American taxpayers.<br/>\nAnd two weeks ago Bush vetoed a 10 billion dollar bill to provide preventative health care to our nations poorest children (less than 1/2 of 1% of the cost of the war in Iraq).<br/>\nThree rounds of tax cuts for the wealthy, the top 1% now have nearly 40% of America's wealth, a larger percent than at anytime in 78 years - 1929 - before the stock market crash and the Great Depression; the number of poor and the number without health care have increased, while the middle class has lost economic ground. Cronyism, the decimation of a great American city, environmental policies based on ideology and corporate greed rather than science; Sure sounds like a President a Christian President, especially one who wears his religion on his chest because I'm sure Jesus would have handled things the same way.<br/>\nWhat we'll do and what we won't has changed, and tragically for the worse. How long to return to the pre-Bush/Chaney America? Some things can never be returned - a dead or blinded American soldier or Iraqi child can never be recovered? Our fundamental morality, our ideals of human rights and human dignity? It's going to take many years, perhaps a generation, to get those things back.<br/>\nIt's a long long ways. Hey pretty darling it's gonna be a long walk home, a long walk home. 4) Badlands: but ultimately we'll spit in the face of even these worst of times and regain the shredded Constitution, we'll eventually look back at the torture that is banned by the suspended Constitution, banned by the Geneva convention, torture that puts us on a par with Nazi Germany WWII Japan, most of the middle eastern countries, friend and foe, many African totalitarian regimes, and ironically, Suddam Hussain - ultimately this barbarism will be only a nightmare our children will have to explain to there's.<br/>\nTogether these four brilliant songs add up to a whole that is more than the sum of the parts. In these four, a genius songwriter/performer takes us from 9/11 to the present.<br/>\nWhat a bittersweet, melancholy, sad, poignant, and most of all, wonderful two hours I experienced on this magnificent night.

You realize the power and soul of the E Street Band in the material prior to 1984. Badlands, Promised Land and Jungleland are timeless. The vibe he emotes in these songs can not be replicated or duplicated. My frends asked me if this was better than his epic 3.5 hour shows. I just said it is different. The last tour I had the priviledge of see him do some of his best old stuff - For You, Racing, Spirit, Jungleland. I guess I could keep on wanting to hear that stuff because I love it so much but to see him re-invent Reason to Believe or play No Surrender or Jacksons Cage is what makes him so rare. One suggestion for this show is that there are old songs that should be paired with the new songs like how about a 1-2 punch of Living in the Future with 10th Avenue Freeze Out or Magic with The River. I think that Bruce is simply the Best.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

A mix of power, passion, happiness and glory. You can read the setlist, and you soon understand that it was a real magic night, but the setlist is just a piece of paper, that says nothing about the incredible night. The show was full of power. It was like you are racing on a 69 Chevy that never stops. From the beginning to the end, Bruce was rocking great, introducing some song in Italian. The voice was brilliant, the guitar went like a train. The crowd went crazy. For sure, the new song were less impressive than the old and beloved hymns: The Promised Land, Badlands, Thunder Road, Born to Run but also Lonesome Day and The Rising let the Italian fans loose their mind and you could see the whole arena raising their hands and you could hear every single person singing loud. Tremendous was the 1-2 shot Incident and E-Street Shuffle, with Bruce saying \"We're going deep now deep now deep now\u2026\". The Magic Songs: Radio Nowhere is an absolutely great start and bring you soon in the heart of a rocking night; also really really great are the sequence Devil's Arcade-Last to Die (great voice, here)-Long walk home (with a extraordinary back vocals from Miami Steve); and also a great performance came from Gypsy Biker. Instead, Livin' in the future, Girls and I'll work for your love seem a little too soft, like a break-moment in the show. I liked very much the \"Magic\" song. The greatest moment of the night, in my own opinion: an incredible \"Reason to believe\" that makes the arena explode; and the Incident-E Street shots. Italian people showed one more time their great love for Bruce, singing and dancing all night long. The band played great, but on stage - now still more than in the past - it seems there's only Bruce. The dream goes on. And we can keep on dreaming. Thanks Bruce!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

This was my first concert other than at the Point or RDS in Dublin. As Ruurd mentioned, during the first songs Bruce was clearly not 100% but still managed to give a brilliant concert and even if he was 100% he gave 100% and the band really helped him out. Came on a total high and didn't come down for days. Thats when we decided we just had to get to Belfast.

But this was better by far. This time, I was only about 15 meters away from the stage and could see Bruce's every movement. The setlist contained a few surprises like \"Jackson Cage\", \"Working On The Highway\" or \"Darkness On The Edge Of Town\". The crowd was fantastic from the first second to the last and I was drenched in sweat after over two hours of pure Rock 'n Roll. When \"Badlands\" came up, all the lights went on and the whole arena was on its feet, singing to the rhythm. \"Santa Claus Is Coming To Town\" was a brilliant Christmas carol, with a big \"Hohoho\" from the Big Man. But \"American Land\" was the greatest part of the show, with me and my father dancing to the song and cheering to the Heartstopping, Houserocking, Pantsdropping, Brainshocking, Earthquaking, Lovemaking, Legendary \u2026\u2026.. E Street Band! It was an unforgettable night and I can only hope, that Bruce and the Band will be back in Germany again soon, for a few more electrifying shows like this one.

The first thing that hits me is that the Norwegian fans is very subdued, after the opening riff everyone stood virtually still. It took half the concert till they woke up by the classic \"The Promised Land\" \u2014 and when they woke up so did the E-Street Band (especially Clemons who smiled thru the entire song). The live highlights became the classics who were slotted in the end and in the encore that people really responded to \u2014 and that gave the band some well needed energy to feed from. By \"Born To Run\" Steve van Zandt, who had been running on and off the stage thru the whole set, woke up and began interact with the audience and by \"Dancing In The Dark\" he began to flirt with the audience. Still the performances of \"Reason To Believe\" and \"Jackson Cage\" were great and musically probably the best of the evening. It was a bit sad but I got the feeling that most people did not know much of the old material such as \"She's The One\" and \"Cadillac Ranch\", one explanation however might be that the sound quality was terrible. I stood two meters from the front (thanks due borderline incompetent security) and I wasn't able to hear much at all of Bruce's interaction with the audience (mainly involving civil rights &amp; politics), I couldn't even hear a word of the band introduction! The quality during the songs were OK (but just OK) but \"Tunnel Of Love\" was barely recognizable. Not said that the concert did not have it's moments, Bruce's charisma is all you need and the decision to use \"American Land\" as the closer is perfect. And Clemons as Santa in \"Santa Claus Is Coming To Town\" will be long remembered. The set list was in general very good, my only complaint is that his concerts has gotten shorter, but I guess that's something you have to accept. He leaves when the show is at it's high and we're all screaming for more, that's how a concert should end.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Thomas Eriksson</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">It was a long and cold day. Got up at 4 a.m and stood in line with two friends for the Gothenburgh shows in July -08. After many hours we finally scored, and tired but happy we got in the car to drive for the Oslo show. Arrived about 4 hours before the show and joined our 2nd line of the day. Finally let inside the arena, excitement grew by the minute. By the time the bans took the stage the crowd was already going bananas. We stood about 5 meters from the stage and had great view of everything. The arena in Oslo is small, only about 9.000 people, so it felt kind of like a small club gig. Radio Nowhere opened and I immediately started crying like a baby, out of pure happiness. Sobbed my way all through No Surrender before I could control myself. The intensity of the show was great, due to the small venue, the band in a crazy mood (even Gary danced like a madman occasionally) and an enthusiastic crowd. The setlist was superb, and for myself, I have always wanted to hear Cadillac Ranch live. I got totally witless during that one and sang my heart out! Other personal favorites were No Surrender, The Rising and the dramatic version of Reason to Believe. Me and my friends were very happy afterwards. Only little complaint was that they \"only\" played for 2.15 hrs\u2026 we're used to about 3 hrs but hey, they're getting old\u2026 maybe summer shows will be longer.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Thunder road, badlands, incident, atlantic city, out in the streets etc. And last night I found myself sitting on the floor in front of my stereo with goosebumps up my back listening to a live version of jungleland. The part where the crowd screams their lungs out singing \"down in juuunglelaaand\" always gets to me. God I love that song. Tomorrow I hope I will \"get\" the goosebumps again. If not while he sings jungleland, then another of his songs from his lifelong work of making me happy. And I'll bet I do. I got the goosebumps Saturday nights show in Copenhagen was wonderful, with a lot of new material, but also with some great hits from the past. Especially The River that from start to end almost was performed with a magnitude by the crowd that took the words out of Bruce's mouth. Though I had come to hear him sing, the power and emotions from the crowd just gave this great song even more soul and depth. Just as low key and emotional as The River were, just as powerful were hits like Badlands, 10 ave., Dancing in the dark and of course BTR. Lots of energy and lots of flirting and connecting with the crowd, that from my spot (third row) seemed to be having a great time. One young girl got a special souvenir to take home with her, Bruce's harmonica. Standing just two rows behind her i could almost touch it :-) The new material worked really well on stage. I have never liked \"girls\" but live it was a great choice, as were living in the future and I'll work for your love. Devils arcade was for me the best song from Magic last night with a rawness but also a feeling of tenderness to it that worked really well. And I was surprised to hear how many that had learned the words to the new songs. Nice. And then there was Kitty's back. I have to admit that I never really liked this song, but hearing it live brought something new and different to it. Got in the pit by pure luck by the way. My first spot was about 10 meters behind the pit, but then one of the security guys said that there were room for more people if anybody was interested\u2026 Needless to say that me and 4 friends more or less jumped into the pit and had great spots just to the left of the stage, in front of Clarence. But then people moved a little bit around and I found my self standing behind what seemed to be the Swedish national team of basketball\u2026 2 meters high and 2 meters wide. But here is a little hint. Bring a pretty blond with you when trying to get up front. My \"partner in crime\" smiled and flirted her way as far as to third row and i toggled along behind mumbling something about being with her, and please let me through too Thanks to all the nice people who let us through.

After the standard opener \"Radio Nowhere\", Bruce and the band kicked in a higher gear and blew the audience away with a \"No Surrender\" as full of pure emotion as it's supposed to be. I've never seen anything more Rock'n'Roll than Bruce and Nils strumming those Fenders as if their lives were depending on it. \"Lonesome Day\" followed before Stevie got to show off in the guitar-drowned \"Gypsy Biker\". After that Bruce and Soozie presented a beautiful version of \"Magic\" and though Soozie's violin sounded disturbingly off (it did that the whole night) it was really something special. The new version of \"Reason To Believe\" was as wild as usual and \"Candy's Room\" always sounds good live. It was now the real magic was about to happen. As the intro to \"She's The One\" was heard the crowd exploded and for the rest of the concert the crowd and the band was as one. After the mind-blowing \"She's The One\" Bruce threw at us \"Livin' In The Future\" and once again singing filled the air. \"The Promised Land\" and \"I'll Work For Your Love\" kept the party going until the tempo slowed down temporarily with the always touching \"The River\". The rest wasn't long and after giving Max a needed shower of water Bruce strummed the opening chords to \"Working On The Highway\" and once again people were standing up moving to the sweet music. \"Devil's Arcade\" somewhat cut the night in two with its unfriendly live sound and Soozie once agin killing the violin. But then \"The Rising\" kicked off the strongest part of the show and from then and on there was no turning back. \"Last To Die\" was rocked through quickly and after a massive \"Long Walk Home\" followed by \"Badlands\", Bruce dedicated \"Girls In Their Summer Clothes\" to 'alla svenska flickor' (all Swedish girls). Seeing a big poster with the letters J-u-n-g-l-e-l-a-n-d, Bruce decided to throw in the epic song in for the hell of it and in spite of Soozie's untuned violin it was something best described as a religious moment. Everybody should get to hear \"Jungleland\" live! \"Born To Run\" and \"Dancing In The Dark\" drove the audience to exhaustion and finally the show closer \"American Land\" followed. Everybody was in that state of mind only Bruce and The E-Street Band can put you in and as we got ready to leave our seats something very special happened. Defying the routines from previous shows, Bruce decided to do an encore after the encore. We soon realised that it was our friends in the pit we had to thank for this since they during \"American Land\" had thrown Santa's hats on to the stage. As a result we got to hear Roy play the opening notes to \"Santa Claus Is Coming To Town\". It was the perfect end to a perfect night. Since it was my first concert with Bruce ever, I probably had my feelings and impressions enhanced by the sheer happiness of seeing him and the band live for the first time but I still think anyone who was there would agree with me on that it was an extraordinary night.

I'm becoming tired of trying to explain to non devotees just how good these concerts are. Nowadays I just tell them to try for a ticket and go! Satisfaction is guaranteed. As others have already mentioned, Bruce defies nature. Just where does he get the energy? He gives everything to each song and no matter how many times he sings them, they always sound fresh.

The show was amazing and Bruce managed to rock out the show with folk. When I heard I got tickets to see the E-street band I was exited but I was sceptical wheather it could top the show the year before. How wrong I was. When he came out on stage he blasted in with Radio Nowhere. The song was amazing on the CD, but live bought a new perspective to it. I absolutely loved Because the Night and Working on the Highway. Clarence Clemons was amazing hit every note on Jungleland. Loved Girls In Their Summer Clothes and Born To Run.

Still puts on a fantastic show, the older tunes still stand the test of time. Thought the 02 was an OK venue, and the sound was pretty good after the first couple of songs. But my complaint is we sat on the 4th tier which as high but a good view, My kids and I were standing up singing and dancing and having a great time which is after all what the Boss is all about\u2026. but lots of old farts where asking us to sit down so they could watch in comfort and other such bollocks\u2026 for Christ sake go and watch Micheal Bubl\u00e9 or Coldplay . Too many middle class corporate types just like at Old Trafford and Stamford Bridge.Rock and Roll belongs to the people, + when did private boxes and VIP areas come into being\u2026 I still go to lots of gigs, but in smaller venues to see mainly new bands.

Who were the people in the pit right in front of the stage and why was there a huge space stage right for them to frollick in? I suspect record company whores but then towards the end Bruce pointed out some people that'd been following him all around Europe. The people pinned into the section further back looked pretty static all the way through. I was up in section 4 with an oxygen mask but found the anomaly a little off putting.

The pre-show queuing situation was a disaster (try some planning please O2 folks!), so I was ready by 8:30 when the band hit the stage. But from the second they crashed into \"Radio Nowhere\" and his Bruceness was all but drowned out by the mighty massed chorus from the floor, I was overwhelmed by the sheer power and intensity of this show. Even by E Street standards, this was relentless, merciless rock and roll. The pace never slackened, words were few and far between, and just about everything was a highlight. Clarence was on top form, nailing everything including a stupendous \"Jungleland\". Nils' solo on \"Because the Night\" was staggering even by his scarcely credible standards. Roy's playout on a magnificent \"Racing in the Streets\" was simply beautiful. Bruce was electrifying all night (how does a 58 year old do that for 150 minutes for God's sake?) and the atmosphere down on the dance floor was joyous. Special mention for the priceless ear muffs with Santa bobble forced upon a mortified Steve \u2014 it's lucky the Sopranos have finished, or he might be drummed out of the family for that! Possibly the best Springsteen show I've seen.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Tim</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">For Rob M.

So Young and In Love was tremendous with Bruce Revved up and running and bouncing all over the stage. It was a much different show than when he played in Hartford in October. Crowd was up on thier feet from the start and very seldom took a breather. May have had something to do with Patti not there. Bruce said she needed to stay at home and I quote \"with 3 teenagers at home now, we live in constant fear of them burning down the house\". Highlights for me were So Young and in Love with Bruce doing full leg kicks and hanging on the Mic stand throughout the song and a killer at least 10 plus minute Kitty's Back which is my all time favorite Bruce song since my deceased moms name was Kitty. I had told my wife early in the show that if he played Kitty's Back I would cry and sure enough I let the tears flow. Seemed like someone knew . All in all after seeing 20 shows of his over the past 30 plus years it seems he had some of the old energy back and did not have that somberness he has shown occasionly the last few times I seen him.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Bryan</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">I didn't think the show was that great.

WE WOULD HAVE TRULY REGRETTED NOT SEEING THIS ONE! Opening with So Young &amp; In Love just set the pace and fit in quite nicely with the theme of making those connections: personal, community and to country. I still feel Human Touch and Cover Me would work equally well in the opening slots. A great, heartfelt rendition of Loose Ends was sandwiched between blistering versions of Reason and She's the One. Janey Don't Lose Heart was ok, but it would have been nice to hear something classic like: Fade Away, Stolen Car or Drive all Night. I never cared much for Devil's Arcade and I believe the reason was that Bruce tended to play a rockin' song like You Can Look, Cadillac or Darlington before Devil's and the transition just never worked. Pairing The River and Devil's Arcade definitely worked and gave me a new appreciation of the song as both songs deal with the frustration of dreams being shattered by reality, but the tenacity of the spirit to continue on. If Bruce continues placing a slower, yet equally powerful song before Devil's, the greater the impact. Wreck on the Highway, Something in the Night and Price You Pay would all contribute to that theme. Love Long Walk Home \u2014 favorite new song of the show\u2014just uplifting and a powerful reminder of the work that needs to be done here at home. Encore time: AMAZING!! A soulful Backstreets into a jazzy, rockin', blistering Kitty's Back was out of this world and had the audience in a frenzy to hear 2 great classics back to back. And I actually like Born to Run leading into American Land as both address the issue of finding that dream that one can call their own, no matter how many highways one must travel or how much hard work one must commit themselves to in order to find that very personal paradise. Probably best show, or at least second best show of the tour for me. A stellar job by all. Definitely looking forward to the rest of the tour and the promise of things to come.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I will say that Reason to Believe featured some smokin' harmonica work which made it a highlight for me, followed by the first whole-crowd-on-its-feet buzz of Because the Night (with an awesome extended solo by Nils) followed by Shes the One. A great mid-set highlight. Badlands was awesome. Jungleland was an awesome addition - there was a guy behind the stage with a big cardboard sign with 'Jungleland' written on it, and Bruce audibled it into the encore. The crowd was roaring and singing along with Born to Run and Dancing in the Dark and I thought the roof would cave in. Amazing.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Robert</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Bruce never ceases to amaze. He surprised everybody by kicking off the show with Night. The show was well paced with the band rarely easing off the gas pedal. Early highlights were Gypsy Biker and Reason to Believe. First goose bump moment came when Bruce dusted off Because the Night and quickly followed it with She's the One. Badlands was relentless and just about brought the house down. Jungleland was absolutely stunning. To seal the deal Bruce finished with a house lights on Born to Run followed by a ripping version of Dancing in the Dark. American Land brought the show to it's ultimate conclusion. If there were any doubts if Bruce still has it last night should silence all the nay sayers. Yes Bruce is still the Boss.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Lots of audience participation and when Bruce let us loose on Thunder Road (which he dedicated to Hamilton), it sounded like the whole house was joining in! Other memorable moments included the stage jumper, Bruce taking the band by surprise during bows after Badlands by starting up the ending again and making them rush back to their instruments, and being called a great audience at the end of the night!

Certainly the best Canadian audience I've ever been part of \u2014 by a mile \u2014 and way better than the crowds at Jersey shows. At the end of Promised Land Bruce gave his harmonica to a 16-year-old girl who was standing beside me against the stage. Wonderful moment. Highlights included Bruce's beauty falsetto at the end of The River and the happening groove the band got into during Kitty's Back.

The Nassau show, if not the best show I've seen of the tour, holds a very close second right behind Hartford night 2. Night exploded on stage, followed by a powerful Radio Nowhere. Adam Raised the Cain was smoking hot, filled with a lot of raw, primal power driving the song to its finish. It's one that should definitely be in the set more often because thematically it fits and it rocks! The triple powerhouse of Reason, Because the Night and She's the One just about tore the roof off the joint. Nils added a firey guitar solo that made Because the Night deliriously intense. A hard-rockin' She's the One followed and had everyone up. I think Boom, Boom, Boom would fit into this slot as well and be another powerhouse song Bruce and band can kick loose on. Bruce definitely surprised me with Incident. A heartfelt and soulful version that for me, being that it's in my top 5 favorite songs, is always a treat to hear. Thanks for playing that one! A very driven Rising, Long Walk and extended Badlands had Bruce pushing himself, the band and the crowd to their limits \u2014 I'm still rockin' from those. Jungleland gave me chills. Beautiful rendition that just reminds you of what makes the E Street Band so special. Haunting lyrics, powerful message, vivid imagery and the band just putting their collective heart into it. The crowd obviously went nuts for this one and rightfully so. Tight version. Time to roadhouse with Ramrod was a surprise and a great rockin' version. Bruce and band looked as if they were having a lot of fun just cutting loose on this one. Next, we need some Pink Caddy, Stand on It or Twist and Shout thrown in for good measure. Amazing, fantastic, tight, powerful, beautiful show from start to finish. Of the close to 140 shows I've seen over the years, last night's show definitely takes a place in my top 30. Once again, thanks Bruce and band for a show that was truly legendary. Any upcoming bands looking to see what it takes to go the distance and represent rock 'n' roll at its best, taking up the torch after Elvis, Chuck Berry and so on,and managing to keep it fresh and alive as well, go see Bruce and the E Street Band and be inspired! And thanks Kyle for holding out until we scored those GAs \u2014 well worth it! Hoping to do Dublin next and maybe hearing a few more classic tracks from The River.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Bruce's singing was outstanding, I think the best I ever heard. He used his hands a lot to illustrate the lyrics\u2026 it was all great fun. And the audience sang just fine I thought. My girlfriend, she had a smile on her face the entire concert. When she sings along, she never takes the easy route, she sings HARMONY! My only gripe: all the band members got decent face time on the video screen, except for Garry and Roy. C'mon crew, we want to see these great E Street Band stalwarts! They showed Mr. Bittan's hands a lot, but that doesn't cut it.

You expect Bruce to give it everything he has, you expect the band to cook, you expect to hear a few old nuggets that blow you away, you expect to lose all your inhibitions as you sing and dance with a few thousand strangers, and you expect to feel exhilarated afterward. The difference between your standard, run-of-the-mill fantastic E Street show, and the absolutely amazing thing I witnessed tonight is what I call the \"Holy shit\" factor. That is, when you suddenly realize that Bruce and the band are playing something you never expected to hear again live, and you can't help yourself from sitting up and saying \"Holy shit!\" And that's what makes tonight's show one of the best I've ever seen, and maybe the best of all time.<br/>\nIn fact, the show started with a \"Holy shit\" moment. When you're an insane Springsteen nut like I am, you follow the shows of a particular tour, checking out all the setlists on the Bruce websites. For months on this tour, Bruce has begun just about every show with \"Radio Nowhere\" from the new album, a great song and one of the best rockers Bruce has ever written. I was ready and waiting for it. What I wasn't ready for was \"Light of Day\". \"Light of Day\", are you kidding me? Where the hell did that come from? And almost from the very first notes of the song, I found myself saying, \"Holy shit!\" To put it simply, it knocked my socks off, and it set the tone for the whole night.<br/>\n\"Radio Nowhere\" was next, and that song is simply lights out when you see it performed live. That song segued into a blistering version of \"Lonesome Day\", and then \"Gypsy Biker\", which I still maintain is the best song from \"Magic.\" And that led into \"Murder Incorporated.\" \"Murder Incorporated,\" how in the world did that get into the setlist? Five songs into the show, I've now had two \"Holy shit\" moments, and Bruce had yet to do a song written prior to the '90's, which is pretty much unprecedented.<br/>\nNext came a hilarious monologue from Bruce. Now, it wasn't one of those rambling monologues from the old days, about Bruce's father and his guitar, or anything like that, but Bruce pointed out that Patti wasn't with the band tonight. He reminded us that he and Patti now have three teenagers at home, and there was some sort of teenage toga party going on, so Patti had to be home to supervise. According to Bruce, it gave a whole new meaning to the term \"homeland security.\" I guess it sounds lame now, but it was pretty hilarious at the time, especially when he joked about the kids ordering a thousand pizzas and baking pot brownies. All the old fogies like me had a pretty good laugh over that. The band then segued into \"Magic\", and then \"Reason to Believe\", and while both were great, they are pretty much staples of this tour.<br/>\nThen came the next three \"Holy shit\" moments. The first was \"Trapped,\" which is not really a Bruce song, but a reggae song that Bruce had made his own back in the early 80's. He played it at the \"We are the World\" concerts, and it was sensational. The live album from that show is the only official recording of the E Street Band doing \"Trapped\", but it soon became a staple on \"The River\" tour, and it was one of the highlights of those shows. Tonight, it was simply jaw-dropping. Bruce is 58 years old, yet he performed this amazingly difficult and strenous vocal as if it was 1981 all over again. I do believe I had tears in my eyes, it was that much of a joyful shock.<br/>\nNext came \"Because the Night.\" Why Bruce never officially released a performance of this song is one of the great Springsteen-related mysteries, because he blows away the generic version by Patti Smith. To be fair, Patti did a great job with the song, but she is not Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. And if Bruce's vocal performance wasn't enough, Nils Lofgren's blistering guitar solo was simply unbelieveable. And if all that wasn't enough, the song segued right into \"She's the One\", which has been played pretty steadily on the tour, but is nonetheless a highlight every night, as the band absolutely cooks on this 33 year-old masterpiece. After singing my lungs out and gyrating like an idiot, I fell back exhausted, and all I could say was, \"Holy shit.\"<br/>\nBruce then introduced Tommy Morello (I think that's the guy's name) from the band Rage Against the Machine, which I have heard about only because it is one of my sixteen year-old stepson's favorite bands. Morello came out to join Bruce on \"Ghost of Tom Joad\", which was my next \"Holy shit\" moment, as in Holy shit, why is he doing this lame song from that putrid album? Shame on me, because what sprung forth was one of the most powerful and emotional songs of the night, with an absolutely unbelieveable guitar solo from this Morello kid. I will never disparage \"The Ghost of Tom Joad\" again. It was a \"Holy shit\" moment for the ages.<br/>\nThe main set on the tour has usually ended with \"Badlands\", which is one of Bruce's best songs from the \"Darkness on the Edge of Town\" album, but has been played to death. But instead of ending the set with that tune, Bruce and the band launched into \"Out in the Street\", one of the best songs from \"The River\" album. I'm not quite sure it qualifies as a \"Holy shit\" moment, but it was a surprise, and it sure was great.<br/>\nThe final \"Holy shit\" moment came with the second song of the encores. Night after night, Bruce has stuck a wonderful old nugget into this slot. Sometimes it's \"Jungleland\", sometimes it's \"Incident on 57th Street\" (which I have yet to experience live), and when I saw the band in Los Angeles last October, it was a joyous rendition of \"Kitty's Back.\" Tonight, it was \"Rosalita\". Yes, Rosie came out tonight in Anaheim, and it was so much fun that nobody cared that Bruce actually forgot the words at one point. Hell, we knew all the words, and we were more than happy to help him out. As I sit here now in my hotel room in Anaheim, with my ears ringing and my throat sore, it is past midnight, which means I am now officially 50 years old. The first time I saw Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, I was 17, and my whole life was ahead of me. I am 33 years older, a whole lot slower and heavier (weight-wise), a respected member of the legal profession, a husband, a father, and a stepfather. But in a lot of ways, I feel just like I did that night 33 years ago. I saw a legendary performance by my favorite band, I had the time of my life, and I feel absolutely drained and exhilarated. Just like I did that December night in 1975. Thanks for a great birthday present, Bruce. There's no doubt in my mind that you are still The Boss.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Tracey</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">This was my first Springsteen concert, and it was an amazing experience.

Tom Morello from \"Rage Against the Machine\" played some of the most amazing guitar I've ever seen - and I've seen Eric, Eddie, Ted, Page, Angus, Steve Howe - and did it on, of all things \"Tom Joad\", absolutely jaw-dropping axe work, with Bruce jamming with him. One of a dozen soul-stirring moments that, after 33 years, keeps me in breathless anticipation of news Bruce is playing live. If you like music, find out why we're all so nuts about him, and go to a show. There truly is nothing and no one to compare him to; he's simply the greatest live performer ever, and the E Street Band is one of the great bands as well. Long may they rock!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Is \"Sandy\" off the setlist forever? Will Bruce be able to ask ?Is there anybody alive out there?? All the questions were answered?and then some. First came the tribute. A surprise, and very touching. The band members came out to a dark stage. The huge video screen behind the stage flashed a recent picture of Danny's smiling face. The crowd went crazy. Everyone in the E-Street family was there to support each other as Patti was back on stage, and Jon Landau was watching from the side sound board. BLOOD BROTHERS started playing \u2014 but it took a few moments to realize it was a recording, as everyone in the band had his/her back turned, and was looking up at the video tribute to Danny \u2014 a montage of many pictures and video clips, many showing a very young and happy Danny with long long hair. It was a moist eye moment. Then \u2014 Roy on the piano, leading into BACKSTREETS. This was raw emotion before us. There was a spotlight shining down on the unmanned B3 organ (with an accordion leaning against it) in one tribute. Max was pounding on the drums like he was trying to break them and imagine Bruce singing \"we SWORE we'd LIVE FOR-EV-ER\" as hard as he can \u2014 and couple that with a song-closing cry like you've never heard before. That was the first song. Then \u2014 Is there anybody alive out there?!?!? Asked, and answered as he went into RADIO NOWHERE. In a way, this was really two shows. The first seven songs were almost like a continuation of the video tribute. The five non-Magic songs were about friendship and/or loss. RADIO NOWHERE was sandwiched into its usual spot, as was GYPSY BIKER (this was either an audible or a pull-ahead, as they were bringing Roy's accordion?). These first seven songs were not, understandably, played with total enthusiasm or cohesion (but with a lot of emotion. The drummer was Mad Max tonight, he was pounding the skins so hard on every song. And Bruce \u2014 he kept wiping his face, and I thought it might be sweat \u2014 but then I realized that I had never seen him wipe his face like that before. The Pro that he is \u2014 I never heard his voice crack. The eighth song \u2014 Atlantic City \u2014 kind of bridged from the tribute stage to the celebration stage. From that point it was on! Nils did the single best, most energetic solo I've ever seen from him on BECAUSE THE NIGHT, lifting himself (literally), the band, and everyone else anywhere near the arena. The rest of the set had a highly energized Reunion-Tour feel to it that grew from song-to-song (although Bruce called us \"Pathetic!\" during the SUNNY DAY sing-a-long \u2014 I thought that might cost us the OUT IN THE STREET AUDIBLE, but it didn't). The first encore \u2014 I'LL FLY AWAY \u2014 was a Seeger Sessions-style tribute, with everyone up front and playing an \"un-plugged\" instrument, including a mandolin and a big-ol \u2014 stand up bass. The rest of the encore was fun and energetic \u2014 and as the band stood on the stage together to say good-bye, you could see the 'whew, we got through it \u2014 thanks for helping \u2014 look of relief.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Souls of the Departed was a perfect selection, one I've been waiting to hear and intensely performed. Wild Billy's Circus Story was a nice tribute to Danny. The triple shot of Candy's Room, Prove it (with Nil's killer solo) and She's the One was outstanding. Darlington was good, but definitely would have been more enthused over hearing the setlisted Streets of Fire. Lost in the Flood was a blistering, intense performance that made up for not hearing Streets of Fire, and preceeding Devil's Arcade, the combo, the imagery, a nice pairing of songs. Long Walk and Badlands are two highlights of the evening without a doubt. Encore time: Thunder Road and Kitty's Back were absolutely great! It was a good show to hppk up with fellow, NJ Bruce nuts, Bill, Kyle and Pete. Off to Greensboro\u2026</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Out in the Streets was great to hear. Love that one from the River collection \u2014 everyone was singing along. Good way to get things started! I normally don't care for Gypsy Biker, but the blazing guitars by Stevie and Bruce was impressive. Then things went into the stratosphere with a steamrolling Saint in the City that sounded like some punk band could have rocked it out. Next came a smoking Trapped, love that song! It should be in the set more often. Bruce took it up a notch from there with a blistering Because the Night, intensely powerful Darkness and smoldering She's the One! If shows are being tapped, this is one to release without a doubt. Mary's Place was actually a good party song to throw into the set. Sunny Day was the only song that killed the momentum, would have like Racing or Incident tossed in. The transition from Sunny Day to Devil's Arcade did not work at all. Point Blank, Price you Pay or Something in the Night would have done that moment justice. Killer Backstreets! Loved it! And roadhouse time with Ramrod. I met the little girl who sang on stage with Bruce the night before and we were both hoping for Ramrod \u2014 so thanks, Bruce. Amazing show! Wild setlist and a high octane performance by Bruce and the band. One of the best shows of this tour, hands down. Glad to have made the trip from Jersey.

Collectively the two shows were just about perfect; the first one for the length and the jaw-dropping encores; the second for the impromptu feel especially at the start. I'm sure the band were not sure what Bruce would call next and at one time Nils was wondering which guitar he needed. The band played on and Bruce shouted out 'Come on Nils' as he eventually emerged from the back of the stage and frantically picked up the song. Outstanding two shows and if Cardiff - the ticket arrived today - is only half as good it will be excellent. We had a Spanish couple in front of us and although their English was a bit basic they amazingly knew every word of every song, even the less well known ones such as 4th July, Asbury Park, Sandy. Summed up the universality of Bruce and the band.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Cardiff never came alive for me. Bruce seemed to be going through the motions for the majority of the show only coming alive for the last couple of songs. Although at almost three hours this must be one of the longest shows of the tour. Great opening number and one I've not seen him do before so that was a highlight. Also the Danny story was a highlight too. The sound was great and on listening to an audio of the show he sounds as good as ever. The people in the pit were enjoying it and it would be interesting to hear their take on the show.

Tomos had made a sign in the queue with a young girl he met, asking for Jungleland. Bruce took it, and then imagine our joy when he came out for the encores with the sign, and then talked about the sign and mentioned Tomos' name. I will never forget that. Fantastic atmosphere, and with those encores, well it just doesn't get any better.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Gray Claret</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Subdued is the word I would have used for Manchester.

It felt like the 2 week break had given the band and Bruce new life and they were really enjoying themselves. A great setlist tonight with numerous highlights, from the opening number, through The River and onto an incredible encore starting with Jungleland and Thunder Road.

However, I must disagree with Andrew about Bruce being subdued. Although this was only my fourth Bruce Show (and third with the E Street Band, the other two being Manchester '99 and Paris 03), I have never seen him play to the crowd so much, he was clearly having an amazing time and I have never seen him do so many requests either. The story about Danny prior to Blinded by the Light was great and he seemed to put a great deal of energy in every number. After enduring fairly poor viewing myself, I managed to sneak into the pit at the front for most of the encore, it was amazing and the thrill of a lifetime. I thought the set list was really varied and I truly think Bruce and the band gave it their all, as they always seem to do - and have some video and photographic footage which was for my benefit only as a reminder of a fantastic night - to prove it. Highlights for me included The River, Blinded By The Light, Rosalita, Thunder Road, Jungleland and Because The Night - but the beauty of having so many people at a show means that everyone has a different take on things and I would be interested to see what other people thought too.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Jim</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">I was anticipating this concert for so long, even after the London O2 concert, because I was on the pitch, so memories of Villa Park 21st June Tunnel of Love tour came flooding back. That concert was my first ever concert and was absolutely fantastic, and the Cardiff show was on the same level, maybe even more so. You grow up and different songs have a poignancy that changes. The River was so charged with feeling and I think the sound of the whole crowd singing along will live with me forever. Other highlights - so many\u2026 Blinded by the Light, Devils Arcade, Because the Night and Badlands which was so powerful\u2026and the encores were a dream come true, Jungleland (Clarence is a God), Thunder Road, Born to Run and Rosalita.

The Cardiff show was the best one of the four I have been to during the Magic tour. The music was as glorious as ever, but it was the way the man communicates with a crowd which takes the breath away at a Springsteen gig.

My seventeenth show and this one was right up there with the best I have seen over the years. Being second row from the stage and just left of the central podium meant having great views and being right in the heart of the action. Like all great Bruce experiences you come away with a mind full of fleeting moments and strong emotions. Having my daughter there next to me (she on her third show) meant a lot for such a great night. This was vintage Bruce. Right from the outset I had no real idea where he was going. Again, like the last few shows, a lot of requests were taken from the crowd and there was plenty of interaction around these. This concert was great in not being as fast paced as many of the recent shows, we had lengthy introductions for a number of songs, most movingly for Danny and the tale of Bruce and the Band raising bail money for him and Vini, the dedication of Thunder Road to long time Springsteen fan Tim Russert and the River for the Welsh valleys. Highlights for me amongst a lifetime of memories: the rousing 10th Avenue getting the pit to fever pitch on the second song; the River with the Millenium Stadium singing along; Bruce coming to the microphone stand on Working on the Highway to find the mic missing; on Mary?s Place my daughter being singled out by Bruce at one point and the small ripple of laughter that put Bruce momentarily off guard after Max?s single drum beat; my daughter getting a big grin from Steve at the end; and possibly the best, seeing the E Street Band in fabulous shape and meeting the great people around me in the pit and in the line outside Gate 2 during the day. Then the encores, the encores! Jungleland with a note perfect Clarence; Thunder Road; and Rosalita, oh Rosalita, what joy, seeing Bruce standing rigid on Roy?s piano and egging Clarence on took me right back to where it all started for me in 1981. The icing on the cake, they will be back!

As expected, from the first moment Bruce and the band hit the stage there was no need for any further explanation regarding the sheer brilliance of a Springsteen concert. At the end , the Dad turned to me and said, \"I can't believe that. What charisma and what an incredible voice. How old did you say he is!?\" More happy converts. As for me, highlight was The River which was just brilliant. Also impressed with Living in the Future.

The pace never let up and a great crowd, fully engaged all around the stadium.

Bruce was much more interactive with his audience than on his previous visit last December. Fans who had queued since 4am on Monday morning were rewarded with classics such as 'Sandy', 'Thundercrack' &amp; 'Fire'. Clarence seemed not at all well, and spent a large part of the show in a chair at the corner of the stage. But when called upon his sax playing was as brilliant as ever.

My son got Bruce's harmonica at the end of Gypsy Biker, and my daughter got a really nice handshake from Bruce and a well used plectrum from Little Steven (Little Steven's name is printed on the plectron) after American Land. And personally we got more that: Ramrod was played as a bonus song on request from me and another guy. Bruce noticed our signs during \"Born To Run\" and nodded to us with a smile. He talked briefly to Steve and picked-up our signs right after BTR. And then they played it without any deletion from the planned setlist. Yes! My son got quite exhausted at the end of the seven encores, but he managed to keep standing right to the end. The next morning (today) he woke up and said: \"I had a dream tonight. I dreamed that I got Bruce's harmonica\". He smiled, because he knew that it was not only a dream. The harmonica was still in his hand.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Lisbet Luise J\u00fcrgens</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">The best concert ever !!!

By FAR! 2nd night was the craziest show I've ever seen with Bruce or anyone for that matter. Usually they change, what, 7-8 songs from one night to the other\u2026 He changed 17!! 17!! 17 songs! Again and this time by far, I truly was blown away! We were standing in the crowds and just grasping for breath. Just check the songs 4 to 14 and you'll understand why\u2026 (Hungry Heart-Summertime Blues-The Promised Land-Backstreets-Roulette-Darkness on the Edge of Town-Janey Don't You Lose Heart-Waitin' on a Sunny Day-Working on the Highway-Because the Night-She's the One).<br/>\nHungry heart is the 4th song! Not an encore! Happy to be on stage, playful and a rock n' roll minister\u2026 That was Bruce on this Saturday night. The part in Mary's place where he calls us and is waiting for our reply again and again and again and again\u2026 that is a baptism, a spiritual experience. He uses the wet sponge to splash water on us as if it was holy water\u2026 we listened and our souls were saved. Guitar solo by Lofgren was if possible, even better this night. Drive all night was magnificent! Not at all an arena song, but it was out of this world! He ended with Twist&amp;Shout, trying to tell us that he wasn't allowed to play it, since that was the song that wrecked the stadium in 85. Did we believe him? Did we listen? Nah\u2026 We begged for it\u2026 we wanted it\u2026 and he delivered! What a finish! He truly is the hardest working man on stage.

It is no wonder that Bruce loves the Swedish audience, and he upheld the tradition finishing with \"twist and shout\", which actually feels like a tribute to the audience from Bruce and the E Street Band!

Bruce being full of energy and flirting with the audience (yeah, the front rows got the human touches with lot of handshakes, kisses and boss leaning on to the hands of the front row people several times!). The highlights of the show for me was Nils Lofgren's guitar solo again on Youngstown (what a song), then powerful Murder inc., Mary's Place was also a clear highlight. Point Plank, Summertime blues, Sherry Darling were in the audience \"pray lists\" and they were great moments. And the Encores then: Rosie for Finland upon a request again, what else you can hope for after Tenth, BTR, Badlands (which was an absolute audience taker). Even though it seems that by the end of the tour the new ones are limited to 4-6 songs per show they sounded great too my own favorite being Long Walk Home and Last to Die. The band version of the BitUSA was now heard for the first time in Finland and and I got the feeling that people kind of re-lived the 1985 again. That was nice. Girls was a nice \"giggle song\" to open the encores. And then the greasy thing happened. Some people had a rather big sign asking for Santa Claus is Coming to Town and oh boy the Santa came (not from Lapland but from New Jersey?.)! What a hilarious moment. Bruce asking several times \"are sure about this? and then ok, you asked for it\". After that twist and shout closed the whole great show during which the Boss finally \"dig\" himself into the hearts and minds of the Finns.

To add to my nervousness, about half way through he went into Backstreets which in recent times isn't usually played at the same concert as Jungleland. Anyway, come the encores and the opening bars of Jungleland begin much to my surprise. This is my lasting memory adding to the Manchester 2003 gig when he played Meeting Across the River which then led into the aforementioned Jungleland.

I didn't have a ticket, but only a contact with a guy I've never seen who maybe had an extra ticket for the third tier, better than nothing I thought so I took a plane by myself and on my arrival in Barcelona I met my contact and closed the deal. Having arrived very early and given the lack of controls, I managed to enter the lawn behaving like the classic sneaky Italian, usually I'm not, but in that case I couldn't resist! However during the concert I naturally met other Italians and right in front of us there was a Spanish boy who throughout the concert kept hoisted up his sign with the request for Pony Boy! My two new cronies and I were terrified that Bruce would grant his request, what the hell all those kilometers and those discussions with my wife to listen to Pony boy! Well no! Luckily the concert was great, the E Street Band didn't break up and above all no Pony boy.

The song selection, the length of the show, the amount of audience interaction Bruce did with the crowd, the show was just amazing. Some stand out moments:<br/>\n10th Ave. Freeze-Out: Perfect way to start the show. It started with the stage going totally dark, with Max pounding on the drums, and then Bruce and Clarence emerged out of the darkness together. Bruce then kept going back and forth along the stage, egging on the audience to sing the \"Whoa-oh-oh\" intro.<br/>\nSpirit In The Night: Bruce was going into the audience along the three walkways that came out from the stage, leaning in among fans, and doing a routine where he would fall back into the audience and then fans would push him back up. He got a kiss on the cheek from a fan during the \"she kissed me just right\" line.<br/>\nSummertime Blues: Before Bruce went into the song he went along the audience collecting signs with song requests.<br/>\nBrilliant Disguise/Atlantic City: Great to hear these both as it was the 80's music that first got me into Bruce, and these two don't get played much.<br/>\nGrowin' Up: Bruce started going through the signs he collected and found one that said \"I'm a ten year old fan GROWIN' UP. P.S., My name is Rosie!\". The cameras found the girl in the audience, Bruce talked to her for a bit, and then played \"Growin' Up\".<br/>\nJaney Don't You Lose Heart: Another sign request. Bruce mentioned that he chose this one since the sign was decorated so nicely, and announced \"This is for my friend Jane!\".Again, another rare 80's song that I was glad to hear.<br/>\nI'll Work For Your Love: Nice to hear this as it was one of the few off Magic I didn't see played during the fall leg.<br/>\nYoungstown/Murder Inc.: Hadn't seen these two played since the Reunion Tour in 2000. These two really rocked the place.<br/>\nWorking On The Highway: Also hadn't seen it played since the Reunion Tour. Bruce threw some water into the audience from where he played the song, one of the walkways into the audience, saying he was baptising the audience.<br/>\nTunnel Of Love: I was hoping for this song tonight more than any other. I had never seen it played at any shows I went to before.<br/>\nBadlands: The audience in my section was totally out of control, jumping up and down and singing, beer flying everywhere, and people banging on the seats.<br/>\nJungleland: Most powerful Jungleland I've seen played. People in my section sang along to every word.<br/>\n(Houselights on)<br/>\nBorn To Run/Bobby Jean/Dancing In The Dark: All great of course. Bobby Jean is one of my top 3 favorite songs. Great crowd sing-a-long on this one.<br/>\nRosalita: The band had already taken their bows, but Bruce was still standing there awhile, and began asking the crowd if they should do one more, and then there was Rosalita. I figured he was going to play it for the ten year old.<br/>\nThe show went on for 3 hours and ten minutes, with 30 songs. I've never seen such a long show.

Excellent versions of Spirit in the Night, Adam Raised the Cain, Growin' Up and Atlantic City. Summertime Blues was an all out rockin moment that brought me back to days with the band over 20 years ago. A solid performance of Janey and powerful, guitar-driven versions of Youngstown and Murder \u2014 unbelievable energy. A stellar performance of Tunnel of Love and fun Working on the Highway. During the encores, this had to be one of the most majestic versions of Jungleland I've heard. And what better way to cap off the night than with Rosalita \u2014 which took everyone by surprise!

I barely had any energy left after the night before, and wondered how the band could have the energy. Another great show, but for me personally I had a better time the previous night, as I was closer to the stage the first night. The second night I was in the back of the place, on top, with 4 empty rows in back of me, and the audience near me didn't stand up until Badlands, so that kinda took away from the experience. Still enjoyed the show though. Highlights for me:<br/>\nOut In The Street - I didn't get this on the other 4 Magic tour shows I went to, and as this was my last show I'd be seeing this tour, I was glad I saw it.<br/>\nTunnel Of Love - Saw it played for the first time the night before, and was so glad to see it again. Nils did this amazing guitar solo at the end of the song that I don't remember him doing the previous night.<br/>\nHungry Heart - I did the sing a long thing in the beginning that Bruce has the crowd do. Except I was the only in my section singing it. Oh well.<br/>\nHeld Up Without A Gun - Bruce should play this more since it fits what is going on today with gas prices.<br/>\nSherry Darling - FINALLY! I never saw this one played before, and finally after 3\u00a0E Street Band tours I got it. I jumped out of my seat and was so glad to finally sing the \"Tell her she wins if she'll just SHUT UP\" line. Again, nobody else in my section reacted to the song.<br/>\nBecause The Night - Nils had another great solo, and even did his trademark flip during the song, not even missing a note along the way.<br/>\nDrive All Night - I wasn't sure what this was at first. I hadn't listened to a few of the songs on Disc 2 of The River in a long time. The audience kinda treated this as a bathroom break song at first, but once it got going, it really got people's attention. Sounded great.<br/>\nThunder Road - Again, glad to hear it as it wasn't played at the other Magic shows I went to.<br/>\nBorn To Run/Glory Days - These were the two songs that my Mom was hoping for more than any other, and she got them back to back. Before the show started, me and a bunch of people in my row were all talking that we wanted Glory Days, and felt that we had a good chance since it wasn't played the night before. Glory Days was the first song of Bruce's that I knew when I was 5 years old, when it was first released as a single, so this song means more to me than any other. Again, it wasn't played at the other 4 Magic shows I went to, so I was glad to get this one at the end of the last show I was going to see this tour.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Lucy in the Sky</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">DRIVE ALL NIGHT!!!

Then after the medley we got Glory Days which was my dads song\u2026 he passed on 2 years ago and I read the words at his funeral\u2026 I cried again as I took it as a sign dad approves of the WONDERFUL Lady I have after many years at trying, thanks Bruce &amp; the band, we love you\u2026 you are a big part of our lives and thanks too to Viv &amp; Andy Dixon who crossed the big sea with us to NJ x.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Tom Cantillon</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">The show, from start to finish, brought me joyfully back to my first experiences with Bruce and band during the River Tour. As great as night one was, this one, for me, was off the charts. Easily in my top 10 of over 140 shows. The River collection was what first drew me to Bruce and my first concert had been December 8th 1980, the night John Lennon died. Tonight's show recaptured the feeling, the high, the spirit and magic of seeing Bruce and E Street Band those first few times. Out in the Streets, Two Hearts, Sherry Darling and Held up without a Gun were amazing as all songs were played with the same passion and energy I remember from the River Tour. Summer time Blues simply kicked ass tonight\u2014Bruce bringing it to another level as the band rocked out.Tunnel of Love is just a great live song and one that is perfect for this tour. Saint in the City had a rough start, but Bruce and band salvaged it and tore it up \u2014 unbelievable. Then Nils sets the place on fire with his blistering, sommersault guitar solo during Because the Night!! Bruce keeps the energy level high with a powerful, rockin' She's the One \u2014 glad it's back in the set. After a strong Mary's Place, Bruce really surprised me with a heartfelt, passionate Drive all Night \u2014 a highlight of not only the night, but the tour. If a live CD is to ever come out from this tour, Drive all Night definitely needs to be included \u2014 AMAZING! Great versions of Long Walk and Badlands. Then come the encores and as Bruce and band played Thunder Road, Detroit Medley and Born to Run, I was still feeling that magic and energy as if seeing them for the first time. After American Land, Bruce rocked us with a fun-filled Twist and Shout three hours later. I'm still flying high from this show. It had that overall effect on me that those early shows had as Bruce and the band and the music worked its magic, making a rock 'n' roll show, a spiritual experience unlike any other. Thanks for a truly memorable night that rocked me, body and soul! You guys are hands down \u2014 THE BEST thing to happen to rock 'n' roll!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Thrilled to see Bruce extending the show to almost 3 hours and totally engaging the crowd. Some notable differences from the earlier part of this tour. First, I have never seen Bruce w/o his guitar as much as this show. He must have gone into the crowd w/o guitar at least a dozen times. Second, there was a portion of the show that just felt like it was 1999 and 2000 - the Youngstown/ Murder Inc / Shes the One trio. Totally enjoyed the taking of the request signs. Thrilled to hear Who'll stop the Rain and I'm Going Down. Jungleland as always was magnificent. For me, this concert was sort of a passing of the torch. Having taken my wife to at least 6 Bruce Shows and my daughter to the 8/2/03 show at Gillette, it was great to now take Adam, my 11 year old son to his first Bruce show. He really wanted to hear Adam Raised a Cain. However, he did not leave disappointed. He got to hear Spirit (one of his faves). He really liked Badlands and Jungleland too - good taste. What is interesting is to see that generation gravitate to the newer material. Adam thought Mary's Place was fabulous as was Living in the Future. I have to admit Bruce did a great job on Mary's Place. The highlight of the evening was to see Bruce right after the show. I told Adam to come to area above the stage exit. We first saw Patti, Suzi and Max leave. It was just Adam and I at that point and Max gave us the big thumbs up. Then Bruce came out (there were about 50 of us at this point) and I started to scream out at Bruce telling him that my son was born in Freehold. Bruce pointed and smiled to Adam to indicate that was absolutely fantastic that he had a new fan in Gillette via Freehold! Made our nights!! I don't think Adam will ever forget the experience.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">John Saia</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Truly an amazing concert rain and all. This gig was for the real Bruce fans and not the record company. I have been going to Bruce concerts since 1978 and there are always firsts at each one. This particular concert included 2, first was Latin Lupe Lu which I don't ever re-call seeing on any playlist or hearing at any concert I've gone to, the second was taking requests from the crowd in the pit. By far this was his best concert since the Fenway gigs in '03'. Hearing Jungleland again was a religious experience, it brought my wife to tears. Clarence was truly amazing on the Sax, it was iconic and Roy Bittan on the keyboards was just as incredible.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Soberboss</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Very crisp sound the best I've heard in 55 shows outside. New Big Ed's HDTV screens are amazing. Crowd never knew Bruce and band were late, it seemed like a fair amount of time to dry-off and test all systems. Great setlist Little Latin and Going Down real treats for long time fans and there were many here tonight. Very cool seeing cute Jersey girl, moms dancing with their kids. This show is in my top ten of all time. The band was working hard and Bruce was pumped and got it done.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Tom Cantillon</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Made the drive up from Jersey and it was well worth it. Some great rarities came out this night. Bruce was on fire right out of the gate with a pumped Summertime Blues. Great 10TH Avenue and Spirit, both of which I wanted to hear again since the GS shows.Tunnel of Love worked really well right after Spirit and then came some real surprises: Little Latin Lupe Lu \u2014 wow! I was driving up listening to Chuck Berry and Buddy Holly, hoping for some oldies to be pulled out, and there it was. Does this Bus Stop was also great, as was Who'll Stop the Rain, which I haven't heard since one of the rainy nights at GS back in 2003. Youngstown then killed the momentum Bruce and band had been building. Luckily he rescued it with a killer Murder and She's the One. Because the Night or Cover Me would have worked better than Youngstown. No surprise song after Mary's Place was disappointing, especially after finding out Racing in the Street had been setlisted. He then seemed to rush through Rising, Last and Long Walk and I was getting worried. But when he started the encores and seemed a bit more relaxed, I did also. I'm Goin' Down and Jungleland were great. Nice to hear Glory Days, but am getting tired of Dancin; was hoping for Ramrod or 7 Nights or even Stand on It. But then a rip-roaring Rosie closed the night and sent me soaring back to Jersey in the wee-wee hours.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

And I thought the setlist was tremendous (Youngstown, Spirit in the Night, For You, Rosie, Murder Incorporated, etc). The whole Crush on You performance was great (practicing before the song started, Stevie saying that we were gonna find out why they hadn't played the song in almost 30 years, etc) and Bruce's reaction after playing the song was fantastic. I liked the return of the 3-hour + show. I was a bit disappointed with the shorter show back in November.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

It's a true rock and roll experience to catch one of the shows that you and the band present. For the moment, the music transcends EVERYTHING, bringing hope, faith, confidence, salvation and pure joy. There's never been another band or anyone else's music that has done this, not just for me, but also for your countless number of fans who have taken the journey with you over all these years. I'll admit, over 25 years ago, I was not a Springsteen fan and did not care for the music at all. That changed after attending one concert and witnessing nothing short of a miracle. From Spirit in the Night, to Born to Run, from No Surrender to Living Proof, from The Ghost of Tom Joad to Mary's Place, the music has sustained me, comforted me, instilled a spirit and belief there is nothing more universal, nothing more uplifting, nothing more powerful than music that comes from someone who believes it himself. Thanks for believing in the power of music and for giving US ALL something to believe in: \"Hey, ho, rock 'n' roll, deliver me from nowhere\".

I've seen 16 shows this tour, starting with the very first rehearsal down in Asbury Park and last night's show was as about as far away from what I would have ever expected on this tour. This tour, a few shows in particular, have really reminded me of the River Tour, the songs, the spontaneous selections, the energy, the intimacy Bruce managed to bring back, which was definitely missing during the Reunion Tour. Once again, I went without a ticket and scored one five minutes after showing up. I've gotten into every show this way except the third night at GS, so overall, I was very fortunate, especially considering 90% of the time, my tickets were VERY CLOSE to the stage, if not GAs. The show itself was a high-octane, powerhouse of a rock 'n' roll show. Bruce and band were loose, energetic and determined to give us one of the best shows I've seen of any tour. Summertime Blues is just a great way to open these shows \u2014 gets everyone up and singing right from the start. Out in The Street and Spirit were perfect in keeping the momentum going. Boom, Boom, Boom was a real surprise, having not heard this one since Tunnel Tour; Bruce really enjoyed belting this one out. From Reason to Believe thru She's the One \u2014 Bruce and band were on fire, a great mini set on its own. Part Man was an interesting choice, although I was hoping for Racing or Drive all Night. Encore time! Hands down \u2014 the best encore set of the tour \u2014 one of the best I've ever seen him do. It was as if he wanted to give an appreciative audience a real treat and he did by playing half the Born to Run album. A romantic Thunder Road, followed by the epic Jungleland \u2014 just an amazing, haunting, powerful song, a rollicking 7 Nights, Born to Run \u2014 blasting into Rosie, adding a fun-filled 10th Avenue definitely kept the crowd going, as did American Land and the closing, feverish Gloria! If I had walked in and just seen the encore set, I would have been more than satisfied. Bruce simply, instinctively, chose the right songs that night to make rock 'n' roll history. There isn't a band out there that comes close to touching what they can do \u2014 and do deliver on a regular basis. Bruce and band are true believers in the salvational power of real rock 'n' roll. And that's the bottom line about Bruce and The E Street Band, they are the real deal, delivering a pure adrenaline shot of rock straight to the heart and soul. Had not my second daughter been soon due, I would have finished out the tour with the last few shows. But all in all, it was a great year taking a ride with this tour. Thanks again for another amazing tour, out of this world performances, and some of the best nights of my life. Hoping for another one not too far down the road, I've got 2 daughters who will be in need of an education in what real ROCK 'N' ROLL is all about.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

He ended the concert with thunder road, born to run, I fought the law, American land and then came back with an dancing in the dark encore where he pulled out and elderly lady from the crowd, danced fore a minute or so and then carried her off the stage.

Bruce and the E Street Band performed about 3 hours with no breaks, what a great entertainer. I loved it when he picked out song request signs from the crowd to add to his playlist. One of the signs read: Let Max sing! Bruce said: It's never been done before\u2026 but that seems to be the best thing about Bruce's concerts; if it's never been done, then it turns into \"it has to be done\"\u2026 within a few minutes, Max was given a microphone! Bruce cares about his fans and that showed when he acknowledged every section of seats in the entire Sprint Center all night long and came down to the audience numerous different times. It's hard to choose which song was the best, but hearing Candy's Room, Mary's Place and Rosalita (Come out tonight) were a big highlight! Before he left the stage, he picked a little girl out of the crowd and let her dance on Stage, then carried her off\u2026 what a memory that will be for her. I definitely saw a legend when I went to the concert. I grew up listening to Bruce's music so I can't believe that I waited so long to see him, but if he tours again, I'll be at the next one! Thank you Bruce and the E Street band for making my first concert everything that I've always heard it would be and much more :-).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Dogs on Main Street</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">I was curious about the song Max Weinberg chose to sing after Bruce Springsteen picked the \"Let Max Sing\" sign from the audience. It's not listed on this set list, but Boys was the 8th song played, between between Spirit in the Night and Cadillac Ranch. Turns out there's a New Jersey / drummer song / Kansas City thread. Boys, by Luther Dixon and Wes Farrell, was originally performed by the Shirelles, an R&amp;B \"girl group\" from Passaic, New Jersey. It was released as the B-side to Will You Love Me Tomorrow in November 1960. The Beatles covered Boys on Please Please Me, their first album released in the UK. It was recorded on February 11, 1963 in one take at Abbey Road Studio with Ringo Starr, one of Weinberg's musical heroes, taking the lead vocal. It was Ringo's first recorded lead vocal with the Beatles. And one more thing, when the Beatles released Boys as a single in October 1965 the B-side was Kansas City Hey Hey Hey Hey.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Especially liked Outlaw Pete, Good Eye, The Wrestler and This Life. Please don't close the main set with Badlands or No Surrender. Perhaps Backstreets or even Born to Run, as done the second night.

Hopefully Mr. Springsteen will also decide to toss in This Life, which reminds me of songs by The Byrds and Beach Boys, a light, harmonious sound that just makes you feel good. Also want to hear What Love Can Do and Last Carnival, 2 of my favs on the new CD. Toss in Fire, Cover Me, Jersey Girl and Drive All Night and we have the makings of one great show.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Tom Cantillon</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">I had been ambivalent about going to the show only because, after having seen the rehearsal shows since '99, one realizes that they are a hit or miss opportunity. For the most part, this was a hit. Opening with Badlands was a smart move because it just energized the crowd from the start and worked well paired with Outlaw Pete. Lucky Day, No Surrender and Out in the Street had a lot of energy and Lucky Day has that vibe and energy as if it had been a track from The River sessions, which I love. Working on a Dream was also good live. A definite highlight came with Seeds, an amazingly powerful and timely song, linked with a rollicking Johnny 99, blistering Ghost of Tom Joad and cautionary Good Eye. These songs worked well together and everyone raved about them! Hopefully Bruce will keep that 4 pack together as he had done in a similar fashion during the reunion tour with Youngstown, Murder and Badlands. The Wrestler was a real surprise and a very nice departure from the fast-paced rock songs. It needs to be coupled with another slow song, such as: Something in the Night, Price You Pay, Stolen Car or Fade Away. Kingdom of Days was also very good. Born to Run to close the main set was amazing because everyone expects it in the encores, but it is a powerful way to end a great set on a positive, passionate note. I hope Bruce keeps it that way! I did want to hear more of the new material, especially This Life, because overall, I was hoping for a different show, something we haven't seen. The Tunnel of Love tour was noticeably different in structure and songs from the Born in the USA tour, and that was refreshing. This tour, with the new material needs that breath of fresh air, casting aside songs and structure that remind fans of either The Rising or Magic tour. Hard Times did that, as did the new material, they made the show feel fresh. Land of Hope and Dreams and American Land worked well coupled together. Overall, a strong performance, with some deliberate thought to a theme. Hopefully more of the newer songs will be introduced, find their way into the theme of the shows and tour, as well as songs that have not been played as frequently. Lonesome Day, Promised Land, Sunny Day and Darlington need to take a rest. Hopefully Bruce will consider some of the following songs: Point Blank, Something in the Night, Stolen Car, Drive all Night, Hard to be a Saint, Streets of Fire, Spare Parts, Wreck on the Highway, Better Days, Real World,Human Touch, Cover Me, and in the encores, toss in E S Street Shuffle and Raise Your Hand. It's been a while for some of these. Time to dust them off and mix the show up a bit. Looking forward to the tour. Excited to hear the new songs captured in full E Street band glory.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I would have liked for them to focus more on the new cd. Play, What Love can Do, pair it with Human Touch or She's the One, both good songs that will keep the momentum going. Toss in Better Days and Cover Me with Born to Run for something more fresh. And work in This Life with Kingdom of Days and perhaps Back in Your Arms or Fire. Develop the romantic theme that is present on the new cd and plant it into the heart of the show.

Out in the Streets \u2014 good choice for crowd sing-along. The 4 pack of Seeds, J99, Ghost and Good Eye is just damn amazing. Best part of the show, easily. Strong songs that really hit home right now. Great choice to lift things up with Good Rockin! Keep it in the main set because it will lift the spirits of all in attendance. Growin' Up, the Wrestler and Kingdom of Days were all very good. Born to Run \u2014 what a great way to end the main set!! Hard Times was great. A spiritual plea for those hard times to be gone \u2014 perfect song choice for this tour. Nice to hear 10TH and LOHAD works well with American Land \u2014 some optimism in this down economy. Low points: Sunny Day, Lonesome Day and Dancing need a break. So many other songs would fit nicely. Lonesome Day just kills the momentum Bruce is shooting for. My choices would be to toss in either Cover Me or Prove it all Night and shelve Lonesome. The Wrestler needs another slow song to come before or after. It needs that emotional impact a second song can give it, such as Lost in the Flood or Something in the Night. Overall, a very, very good show. Was hoping to hear Last Carnival for Danny.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

He's usually quick to pick up on these things, so hopefully he'll sit down and take a hard look at the setlist and give it some major thought. I liked Kingdom of Days a lot and didn't think I would, but pair it with a better song than The Wrestler. Play Tunnel of Love, Fade Away, Sandy, For You or NY City Serenade. As far as closing the set with some high energy, add Prove it All Night, Adam Raised the Cain, She's the One, Backstreets or I'm a Rocker with the closer, Born to Run.

Where's the lush, romantic sounds and themes that are throughout your new collection of songs? Yeah, many of us have been hit by hard times and I can dig some of those songs: Badlands, No Surrender, Seeds, Ghost, J99, Hard Times and American Land, but what about the focus of the new material? Where's What Love Can Do, This Life, Queen and Tomorrow Never Knows? Ok, maybe first half of the show, give us a set that echoes these hard times with also some hope, but then get to the new cd, man and play it like it REALLY MATTERS!! So many great songs on the new cd that aren't even making it into the set. The new songs are refreshing, especially This Life, Kingdom, What Love can Do and Queen. Put them in and find some rarely played material that would fit: For You with This Life, She's the One, Fire or Better Days with What Love can Do, The Fever or Fade Away with Queen of the Supermarket, Wreck on the Highway or Something in the Night with Tomorrow Never Knows and toss in Drive all Night and NY City Serenade and you've got one kickass second half of the show that places a spotlight on your new material and the theme to the cd. And please play Last Carnival. It totally captures the essence of the entire collection about the love,life and friendships that we have and need to cherish now, while we still have them. You know it's there, that's why you wrote those songs and put out this new batch. So play them with all that passion and urgency that you've played every other song on previous tours and faith will be rewarded!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Yes there were many die hard fans but the \"sing alongs\" were the quietest I ever heard. I mentioned to my date ( who had never seen Bruce before ) that if this was in Europe or Jersey the crowd would be ten times louder. The crowd aside Bruce and the E Street band laid it all out to perfection once again. The crowd did come alive with Out In The Street ( who wouldn't ) I felt The Ghost Of Tom Joad was the most compelling number and Nils guitar is amazing. The band really hits it's stride with Cadillac Ranch and Hard to Be A Saint In The City which were both shot from the hip, not from a setlist when Bruce took some placard requests from the crowd and shuffled through them, picked these two and told the band what key to play and blasted away. The band played with no intermission, their energy is always amazing with Born To Run it's final of the set with full house lights on. Six more songs to go in the encore with Hard Times Come Again No More being a fantastic and timeless piece written back in 1853, a song befitting for our country in these times. The last four songs couldn't have been any better. Land Of Hopes And Dreams seems to be a standard closing song for Bruce which I never get tired of hearing , the song will sooth your soul. American Land was another amazing piece which featured accordion , violin , acoustics and perfect harmonies, to an Irish beat which was fun to watch.

Badlands is a great opener, and BTR a great set closer. Other thoughts: This show was nowhere near the \"lousy economy downer\" that 1 or 2 previous posts suggested. Also, Bruce's hair is very short for him, and he looked to be in great shape. Clarence was fine, although he did sit most of the time and even played the sax while it was on its stand once or twice.

It is great to have land of hope and dreams back in the encores and there's not a better song to close a concert than with Rosalita. All in all, it was a tremendous night of music.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Jack</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Nearly a flawless show. Badlands into Darkness was terrific. Seeds, J99 and Ghost of Tom Joad simply had me stunned. Powerful threesome. Seeds really kicked ass! Raise Your Hand!! About time!! What a great song, full of energy and in my opinion, needs to be a staple in the shows. Encore time, break out Raise Your Hand and retire Dancing.<br/>\nRYH fits more with the overall theme of the show and goal of Bruce and band \u2014 to have a rockin' awesome time. Spirit, always a pleasure. Another terrific threesome came with The Wrestler, the always fantastic Racing in the Streets and a beautiful Kingdom of Days. Those 3 should remain in the set as they are. Without a doubt, another highlight that took the show to another level. Lonesome Day and Rising, only low points. OVERPLAYED!! Toss in Lucky Day, Cover Me or Prove it with Born to Run and you've got yet another killer threesome. No better way to close a great show than with Rosie.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Loved Seeds &amp; Johnny 99 and listening to Nils cut it open. I was dismayed with the four songs that Jay did. I felt and thought that the sound was rushed and that they were being played way too fast. I hope that with some more time playing live with the band he'll fill in admirably, but forright now it brought back too many memories of Zach playing drums on the Human Touch/Lucky Days tour.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Pete</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Overall - I'd say it was good, not great. Some immediate \"morning after\" reactions while everything is still fresh in my mind. Badlands works well as an opener. Got everybody into it right away. Of all the shows I have seen I think this opener and then The Rising may have been the best show openers. Jay Weinberg can freakin' play. He brought some serious power and energy for his 4 songs. The crowd totally fed off it - it was interesting seeing Bruce give him instructions during song transitions and bridges. Outlaw Pete, which I'm slowly warming to on the album, was outstanding. One of the highlights of the night I thought. Johnny 99 ROCKS. He did \"I'm Bad, I'm Nationwide\" by sign request. The sign had lyrics and key progression on the back. They killed it - great fun rockin' song.<br/>\nVery odd not seeing Federici on stage. Slightly different sound too, which I thought was noticeable. Sad. I'd lose the background singers and replace them with horns \u2026 I'd also lose the fog machine. Its not a Bachman Turner Overdrive show. Bruce was sick. I give him huge credit for gutting it out, but when your sick and trying to do a 3 hour muscular show it has got to be tough. He was doing farmer's blows all over the stage, and kept having to step away from the mic to cough. I think his energy level was down as a result. I pity the roadie who was on post show \"Bruce booger cleanup patrol\" Clarence. Holy crap. I had no idea he had aged this much. He stood maybe (maybe) 3 times during the show - all solos were from his stool. He also played very softly - there was no huge power blast when he needed it. Almost a non existent stage presence. And even when he did stand, between his huge black nightgown thing and big hat, you couldn't eve see him. The sound was muddled - tough to hear Roy or Clarence - although this may have been due to our seats, we were 20 rows up slightly behind stage right looking down on Roy. All of the above not withstanding, the show seemed a bit scattered. No recurring theme as he has had in I think every ESB show I have ever seen. Only 4 songs from WOAD, and aside from Outlaw Pete, the new stuff was pretty flat. I was looking forward to hearing The Wrestler, but he struggled with it because of being sick (coughing, etc.). It felt like more of a greatest hits show. As I'm sure you know, this has been a criticism so far this tour, and after last night, I thing the criticisms are warranted. One of the things I love about his shows is being both inspired, and then followed by those moments when he moves from it into 5th gear and gets the crowd going bananas \u2026 and then somehow jams it into 6th gear \u2026 and then even higher \u2026 all backed by great musicianship. We never got there last night \u2026</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">'RBB'</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">As usual the band did not disappoint.

Yeah, they're old man. Did you not see Nils Lofgren, were you obsessing on Clarence all night? Nils took the roof off the place.

He launched into Badlands and Candy's Room, I thought he was off key and definitely had a cold or something. I was getting this ill feeling that I am going to see my first dud of a show from Bruce. He launched into Outlaw Pete. I was relieved to see the passion into this song that had been missing from the pair of Darkness (btw - my favorite album). Outlaw Pete is destined to be a classic song. Then we got She's the One. I have always liked the song but I have seen it in my last 7 times that I have seen Bruce. It was also a little flat as well and off key. Not used to this. He then went into Working On A Dream. Nice version and it worked well with the crowd. He played Raise Your Hand which got the crowd going as well and he was collecting the signs. This time the signs had a twist - he wants to do at least one cover the band has never done before. Tonight it was I wanna Be Sedated. They did it fabulously and it turned the corner for the night. Bruce sensed it and did a pair from Greetings - Spirit in the Night and For You. Spirit in the Night is one of those songs he can do every time and I will love it every single time he does it (Promised Land and Jungleland have that effect on me as well). The trio of Waiting on A Sunny Day, Promised Land, and Jungleland really reved the crowd up. I thought to myself can he keep this up with the cold. He went into Kingdom of Days. I did not like this song on the album but live it works! Bruce has a funny way of taking album songs and making them Pop on stage. After Kingdom, he brought Jay Weinberg. All I can say is wow. Being a big Max fan, I thought why do they have to do this. Now I see why - just a great vibe to Radio Nowhere, Lonesome Day, Rising and BTR. In particular Lonesome Day and Rising were better than the last two tour versions. The encores were good especially the added treats of the Dropkick Murphys on American Land and Glory Days. Loved Thunder Road and the so Young and in love! Bruce added 7 nights to Rock. It was not a particularly good version of the song but just the fact that he broke out an additional song was amazing on a night where he clearly was not feeling his best.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Stuart</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Went to both nights amazing, second night incredible.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

It was the band's first time back at the Spectrum in almost ten years (Bruce did two superb solo \"Devils and Dust\" shows there in 2005). The band's last appearance at \"America's Showplace\" was the truly unforgettable \"birthday show\", on 9/24/99, the day after Bruce's 50th birthday. Philadelphia is generally regarded as one of the two or three best cities IN THE WORLD to see a Bruce show. The combination of rabid fans, along with Bruce's appreciation for the city's impact on his career (I won't bore you with any Ed Sciaky stories here) ALWAYS translates into a superior show. Because of this, Springsteen-o-philes from around the world descend upon Philly for these events, stacking the crowd with even more great fans. It is always a wonderful scene. Bruce has become fairly consistent with his start times so far this tour. Certainly, he didn't begin at the ticketed start time of 7:30, but he has been coming out at around 8:15 each night. Patti was not present for the show, as she continues to recuperate from a horse fall that injured her ribs. For night one, my girls and I were sitting in the second level, in the corner behind the stage. We had a terrific vantage point, and we could see the backstage area, as well as everything going on onstage. The sound was a bit muddled, and we all had difficulty throughout the show understanding everything that Bruce said when he spoke. I feel strongly that the crowd can influence the type of show that you see at a Springsteen event. The performer feeds off of the crowd reaction and response, and I am convinced that this is one of the reasons for such great shows in Philly. I'm not sure whether our seat location had anything to do with it (being somewhat behind the stage, the crowd noise and energy was being directed towards us), but the crowd was TERRIFIC from beginning to end. Being a sophisticated \"crowd energy watcher\" I don;t believe it was the seats. It was very noisy, and as always, the fans took their part in the show seriously. In Philly, we know when to respond and how to respond. The show opened the same way that it has for the dozen preceding shows on the tour - with \"Badlands\". In my opinion, this is Bruce's greatest live number, and the crowd obviously went wild with their fist-pumping and chanting. Even though this song was the opener during the \"Darkness\" tour back in 1978, many people feel that this powerhouse song should be placed somewhere (anywhere) else in the setlist. I agree with this line of thinking (it's placement at the end of the main set on the Magic tour was awesome). Song two was \"Out In The Streets\", which kept the energy level high, and the crowd participation was huge. Next was one of only four songs from the new cd - \"Outlaw Pete\". This is Bruce's only shot at an \"epic\" song from \"Working On A Dream\", the record that is being supported by this tour (I think). For this song, a white sheet was extended across the back of the stage (~ 5' - 8' high) which was used to create a shadow image of Bruce when the proper lighting was used. Towards the end of the song Bruce dons a cowboy hat and the silhouette effect takes place. First, I'd like to say that I enjoy this song (it seems to be a love or hate deal with this one). The showmanship seemed a bit corny, though. I prefer Bruce being corny when he is playing it up and not taking himself seriously. Also, this visual effect could only be appreciated by a small percentage of the crowd. Certainly, no one in the second or third level of the arena got anything out of this. Bruce is notoriously low-tech with his shows, and I have always liked it that way. During earlier shows on the tour, smoke machines were used. Additionally, some type of laser lighting (left over from the Super Bowl appearance) was even employed. Thankfully, those gimmicks were left home for these shows. Philly crowds always go crazy for \"She's The One\" and Tuesday was no exception. Bruce left a lot of the singing to us, and we came through for him. \"Working On A Dream\" was next. I'm just not sure about the presentation of this one. In the middle of the song Bruce talked about being in Philly and at the Spectrum, which was great. He spoke heartfelt words about the history that exists between us, as he mentioned that he had appeared 30 previous times at the Spectrum, and that it was the spot of his first arena show. He then launched into the \"building a house\" riff, which seemed a bit awkward and forced. It seemed to bring the energy level down in a hurry. Next up was the tour staple \"recession pack\". Tonight it was \"Seeds\", \"Johnny 99\", and \"The Ghost Of Tom Joad\". The casual fan might not appreciate this mini-set of tunes that explore different aspects of tough times, especially since these are not \"hits\". For me, this was one of the key themes for the show, and was presented very powerfully. Bruce has always said that the E Street Band was built for tough times. This grouping pulls a few examples of how he has written about negative life experiences. For sure, this overriding theme was in Bruce's mind when he selected \"Badlands\" as the opener. I would be completely remiss if I did not acknowledge the stellar solo by Nils during \"Tom Joad\". He is a phenomenal guitarist, and it is great to see Bruce giving him a bit of a spotlight each night. Just as with \"Badlands\", where amongst all of the anguish \"it ain't no sin to be glad you're alive,\" after the somber \"Tom Joad\" it was time to \"Raise Your Hand\". I have been a vocal opponent of the sign thing at Bruce shows, as I believe that it distracts from the focus of the show. As Bruce collects the numerous signs from the crowd, the intro to \"Raise Your Hand\" is played. Once he has collected his fill of requests, the entire song is played. Sorry, but for me, \"Raise Your Hand\" is a show closer, not a mid-show throwaway. I will say that the crowd in the pit showed the most \"sign restraint\" that I have seen to date, as there was almost no distracting signs being thrust into Bruce's face each time that he approached the pit during songs. The sign thing did yield a true, unplanned highlight - \"Fire\". Bruce acknowledged what he called \"the finest sign that I have ever seen\", which was in the lower level behind the stage, as opposed to in the pit. It took seven people to hold up the sign, as four each held up a letter from the title and three others surrounded it by holding up orange flames. This sign could not be ignored! It was a great version of the song, and Clarence joined in for maximum crowd reaction. Next, Bruce spotted a huge banner behind the stage requesting \"The Fever\". The band, including the two backup singers on hand for this tour, launched into a superb rendition of this Philly special (this song had been worked up, rehearsed, and was on the handwritten setlist). The crowd, fully expecting to hear this song on at least one of the nights, showed their appreciation in kind. Another absolute highlight for me. Another sign request was \"Mountain of Love\", which Bruce reminded us that he played in the \"Main Point\" days. He had also played this song last year in St. Louis at the end of the Magic tour. Max's son, 18 year old Jay Weinberg, took over at the drums at this point for an 8 song stint, which started off with \"Waiting On A Sunny Day\" and continued through the main set closing \"Born To Run\". In between was \"The Promised Land\", \"The Wrestler\" (excellent performance), \"Kingdom Of Days\", \"Radio Nowhere\", \"Lonesome Day\", and \"The Rising\". When Bruce came out for the encore set, he again warmly spoke about Philly and the Spectrum, and gave his PSA plugging Philabundance and the work that they do. This was a perfect lead-in to \"Hard Times Come Again No More\", which was written by Stephen Foster in 1854. I enjoyed the performance, which featured all band members lining up across the front of the stage. The two backup singers, who toured with Bruce on the Seeger Sessions tour, were featured during this song, which expresses sympathy with the downtrodden. Next up, Bruce went back into the pit to search out a sign that he noticed earlier. The song was \"You Can't Sit Down\", a tune by Philadelphia's Dovells. Little Steven actually toured with the Dovells a million years ago. This song, while fun, did not seem to get a great reaction, especially for the encore slot that it was given. From there, the encore set rolled on with \"Tenth Ave. Freeze-Out\", \"Land of Hope And Dreams\", and \"American Land\" (I'm not sure why both of these songs appear together). After \"American Land\", Bruce and the band began taking their bows. It looked as though he was about to go into his \"I'm too tired\u2026\u2026I need to go home\u2026\u2026..It's too late\u2026\u2026\u2026\" shtick to egg on the crowd. But, he changed gears and said to the crowd, \"One more for Philly\". He then performed \"Rosalita\" to close out the evening at 26 songs. For me, \"Rosalita\" lost it's luster during the 10 show Giants Stadium stand, when it seemed that he was going through the motions with \"Rosie\" to throw the fans a bone for putting up with a stadium show (boy do I overthink these things!). Some handwritten setlist analysis - \"Radio Nowhere\" was setlisted in front of \"Seeds\". \"Thundercrack\" was setlisted instead of \"Sunny Day\" but not played. \"No Surrender\" was listed as a possible after \"Born To Run\" to close out the main set, but not played. \"Kitty's Back\" was setlisted instead of \"Rosalita\". Night one was a terrific show with several memorable highlights. The Philly crowd lived up to it's reputation, and Bruce gave us a super performance once again.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">McMurphy</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Loved it. Keep those signs for the old classics coming. The Fever was outstanding. Bruce, don't make this one a one-night play, toss it in more often so other fans can be treated as well. Killer version! Raise Your Hand!! Oh, yeah! Love hearing the oldies: Mountain of Love and You Can't sit Down\u2014amazing versions. Someone needs to make signs for Jailhouse Rock, Rave On, Hound Dog, Great Balls of Fire and perhaps some Dylan. Would love to see the band tear thru Highway 61, Groom still Standing at the Altar or From a Buick 6. Looking forward to Hershey Park. Last summer, it was one of the best shows of the tour.

Man, that band smokes no matter what they play. She's the One was intense. Seeds, which I'd never heard before blew me away. Raise Your Hand got all those folks who for some reason were reluctant to get off their asses, to get up and actually enjoy the show. The Fever!! UNBELIEVABLE! I want to see them rip up Fortunate Son, Long Cool Woman and some classic Chuck Berry. Bruce should do a night of request and toss the setlist aside for a few shows. Looking forward to Nassau. I'll be in the pit with a sign for either Fortunate Son or Up Around the Bend.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Tom Cantillon</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">For me, this is where it all began on the night of December 8th 1980,so I knew that without a doubt, I had to be there tonight. A terrific, fun, high-energy show full of surprises that made me feel as if I were once again in attendance at one of those memorable 80's shows. Opening with Badlands is simply a terrific way to breath life into the song and jumpstart the show simultaneously. Out in the Street is always a fun song to sing along to. Another blistering version of She's the One followed a high energy Outlaw Pete. A smoking Seeds kicked ass; always felt it was one of Bruce's best and deserved to be back in the show. A high-energy Johnny 99 and intense Ghost made for a highlight of the evening. Love Raise Your Hand and am grateful Bruce dusted this one off and placed it in the main set. It simply kicks the show up several notches and gets those holdouts still sitting in their seats to finally get up. Great version, full of spirit. Keep it in for the rest of the tour because it works! Sign time: Fire was great to hear, but the real surprise came with a smoldering, bluesy version of The Fever. A classic performance and, if Bruce ever releases a cd from this tour, it would be a mistake, a huge mistake not to include it. A rocking Moutain of Love was a treat and kept things moving. Sunny Day is ok, a bit overplayed, but what other options for sing alongs: Hungry Heart and perhaps Sherry Darling. Kingdom of Days is very good live. Makes me want to hear more from the new cd and what the band can bring to those songs, especially This Life and What Love can Do. Radio Nowhere, it's ok. There are far better songs that can drive that last quarter of the main set into a total meltdown: Cover Me, Trapped, Because the Night, to name a few. Lonesome Day and Rising are fine songs, I like both, but for me, they're just a bit overplayed also. Wouldn't mind if he switched them up with No Surrender, Prove it, Human Touch or Glory Days. Rotating the songs would manage to keep them a bit more fresh. Closing with Born to Run \u2014 outstanding! Encore time: Hard Times is a spiritual, hope-driven song, perfect for the show. Tenth is always fun. Nice pairing of Land of Hope and Dreams with American Land, they fuel the optimism for better days. A great, rollicking version of You Can't Sit Down definitely helped to maintain that 80's feel as Bruce and band tour thru it with all the gusto one would expect from the best rock band to ever hit the stage. Closing out the night with Rosie was just a perfect way to send this crazed and satisfied crowd home. Hands down, one of the best shows I've seen them do anywhere. Made me miss those River tour shows, but also reminded me to be glad that I was there, then, and now, to witness something magical, as only attending the Church of Bruce can do.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Turk</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Bruce was great as always would have love to hear incident, backstreet, lost in flood, darkness, but all in all still an amazing show and totally pumped when i left!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

In addition to whatever psychological reasons there might be, I feel that there is a very practical reason for this. Bruce never schedules more than two nights in a row for shows, whether it is one city or several on a tour. On night one, he knows that the next night he has to summon up the incredible energy needed to perform once again. On night two, he knows that he will have the following day off and he can play until he drops. Also, he knows that there is a huge amount of fans that attend both nights of a two-night stand. Bruce takes great pride in the fact that every night is a different show, so he puts a lot of thought into changing things up. Historically, the \"wow\" setlists invariably occur on a night two. As an example, night two at the Spectrum featured TEN songs that were not played the night before. Wednesday's show started ~ 8:15 once again. Each night, Bruce walks Clarence up the steps to the stage - the Big Man is not very mobile at all. He spends most of the evening sitting on a stool, and only moves to the center of the stage for a few solos (\"Badlands\", \"Promised Land\"). My girls and I were sitting in the second level, just on the other side of \"center ice\". We had a great view, once again (every seat has a great view, which is why the Spectrum should be allowed to live!). We all agreed that the sound was better for us on night two, as it was a bit easier to understand Bruce when he spoke. Obviously, our location may have played a large part in this observation. The show started with \"Badlands\" once again, and we were off. The first switch from night one was \"The Ties That Bind\", which sounded great. \"Outlaw Pete\" also sounded great to me (I might me in the minority on this one) but, again I was not a fan of the presentation. After Pete, Bruce asked if we could \"Feel the Spirit\" - we surely could. An excellent rendition of \"Spirit In The Night\" followed, with a lot of time spent at the pit by Bruce. After \"Working On A Dream\", which included the \"building a house\" exhortations, came the recession pack. Tonight, instead of \"Tom Joad\" we got an intense \"Youngstown\". We weren't disappointed about missing Nils' fabulous solo on \"Joad\", because we got an equally phenomenal solo from him on \"Youngstown\". It is worth noting that during the band introductions (during \"American Land\") Bruce deservedly calls Nils \"one of the greatest guitar players in the world\". Next it was sign time and \"Raise Your Hand\" once again. I'm not sure if this is cheating, but, after seeing a sign for the Clash's \"London Calling\" the night before, the band worked up the number. It even appeared on the handwritten setlist with a \"?\". Bruce pulled a sign from the crowd asking for it, which also taunted \"did this stump the E Street Band?\". This was a perfect prop for Bruce to mug it up with, as he scoffed at the thought of the band being stumped. Cheating or not, I am thrilled that they rehearsed this one. The song rocked, and it was one of my highlights of the evening. Patti was back for night two, as she continues to recuperate. I am not a Patti fan by any stretch, but I really noticed a positive difference in night two with her vocal contributions. Bruce introduced Patti, then sung \"Red Headed Woman\" for her (and with her, as she took some of the verses). The whole thing seemed a bit awkward to me, and there was an awful lot of \"kissing up\" in the vibe. Believe it or not, Bruce actually made it a point to say it takes \"one\" red-headed woman \"to get a dirty job done\". Was he being this specific because of the rumors about he and another \"red-headed woman\"? Bruce talked about his \"Main Point\" days again, and then we all grooved with him for \"Thundercrack\", which was stellar. Bruce was visibly gratified by the instant (and loud) crowd participation on this one. Bruce, Nils, and Soozie were great as they jammed at the front of the stage during the group solo (is that an oxymoron?). Towards the beginning of the Magic tour, Bruce played \"Thundercrack\" in the encore set on a nightly basis. The response to this song in Philly last year was amazing. At that show, at the end of the song Bruce simply said, \"Thanks, Philly\". It seems that Philly was the only city to embrace it (including in Jersey), and it soon disappeared from the Magic setlist for good. I was thrilled that he remembered the Philly reaction last time, and that he brought it back for the Spectrum. The band was all set for \"Sunny Day\", but an instant before Bruce strummed the first note, he switched guitars, gave the audible to the band, and went with \"Hungry Heart\". Always a crowd favorite, the sing-along was strong. During the last chorus, Bruce left the stage, sat on the hockey \"boards\" and thrust the microphone into the face a sweet looking older woman. Of course, we all knew that it was Adele Springsteen, the Boss's mom. She did a pretty lousy job remembering the words, which tickled Bruce, who kept saying, \"c'mon ma! c'mon ma!\" After a quick kiss, he was back on stage saluting his mother with some Italian phrases that I couldn't catch. A very warm moment.<br/>\nI have heard \"The Promised Land\" innumerable times over the past few years. The rendition on night two at the Spectrum was the finest version that I remember in a long, long time. There was an intensity that I hadn't felt from it for a long while - a great classic performed in great fashion. Another Philly special was \"The Streets of Philadelphia\", which was greeted with the hometown appreciation that you would expect. Jay Weinberg took over on drums at this point, and finished out the final 11 songs of the show. \"Kingdom of Days\", which is my favorite song from the new cd, sounded great with Patti included this evening. This number was a good example of the positive impact that her presence had (no offense to Soozie, who did a fine job the night before). \"Radio Nowhere\", \"Lonesome Day\", \"The Rising\", and \"Born To Run\" closed out the main set once again, and the encore began with \"Hard Times Come Again No More\" just as the night before. Bruce dedicated the next song to Harry Kalas. He introduced an audio clip that was recorded by Harry the K ~ 1986. Harry is doing play-by-play and announcing a rookie coming to bat named Bruce Springsteen. He is facing The Big Man, who is bringing it at 95 mph. Springsteen hits a grand slam, called as only Harry can do it. At this point, Bruce is running around the imaginary base path, blowing kisses to his baseball fans. It was a very cool thing to see and hear, and another example of the Bruce - Philly history together. This led to a FANTASTIC \"Thunder Road\", with Bruce beaming at the crowd as we sang our parts (and most of Bruce's parts, too). Due to Clarence's physical condition, Steve stood at the opposite end of the stage from Bruce during the final instrumental stanzas of the song instead of Clarence. I LOVED this performance of my favorite song of all time. \"Tenth\", \"LOHAD\", and \"American Land\" followed, just as on night one. After the bows, Bruce once again said \"One more for Philly\", but this time added, \"and one more for the Spectrum\". We were then treated to a jazzy, solo-filled, cool-rocking, finger-snapping, crowd-loving, 15-20 minute \"Kitty's Back\". Bruce was so pleased with the song and the crowd interaction that when it ended, he spontaneously called for one more reprise of the finale. What a super way to end a terrific show. Final bows and then the band left the stage, with Bruce helping Clarence back down the steps, and it was over. Mysteriously, \"Working On A Dream\" was NOT on the original handwritten setlist (I think that this was just an oversight, and it WAS intended to be played). Otherwise, the only change from the handwritten setlist was the switch from \"Sunny Day\" to \"Hungry Heart\". This leads to an observation regarding the impact of Jay Weinberg on the shows. While it is true that Jay brings new excitement to the band, and he can surely pound the skins, I think that it takes a lot away from the show. It is obvious that we are watching Jay's \"rehearsals\" for his stint in Europe for the shows that Max cannot attend (due to his obligation to Conan O'Brien at the start of his elevation to the 11:30 time slot). Bruce spent a lot of time looking at Jay and guiding him with his head movements to be sure that he was in sync with the band. With Jay playing drums on the entire encore set on night two, this left no chance for any wild, last second audible by Bruce to play some obscure song from 30 years ago (\"The Price You Pay\", anyone?). It is extremely rare (especially in Philadelphia) for there to be only one (or two) diversions from the handwritten setlist. I feel that some of the spontaneity of the shows was taken away by Jay's presence. Call me nostalgic, but I want to see Max behind the drum kit for every note. I love seeing how he reacts to the slightest movement, or even facial gesture by Bruce. Their musical relationship is truly one of the coolest things about a Bruce show. Of the two shows, I believe that night two was better, mainly because of the stellar setlist (\"Spirit\", \"Thundercrack\", \"Thunder Road\", \"Kitty's Back\"). The crowd was awesome on both nights (as Philly crowds always are). The relationship between Bruce and Philly cannot be denied (for his first two albums, Bruce's record sales from Philadelphia made up a huge percentage of overall national numbers), and Bruce's appreciation is palpable. I do think, however, that maybe, for the first time in my life, the buildup and expectations for Bruce show(s) were too great for an almost 60 year old performer to match. These shows were great, terrific, fun, exciting events. But, I don't think that the word legendary applies. Having said that, I must point out once again - Bruce Springsteen NEVER disappoints. In closing, as I always say, I am very lucky to be from Philadelphia, home of Bruce Springsteen's greatest shows.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Eric G.</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">I was the closest I've ever been at any concert I've been to. I checked the Wachovia website the night before to see if any more tickets were released, and seats had been released in section 218. I bought 2 seats for my mother and I, and I thought we were going to be on the second level. To my surprise, the 200's were actually the first level. Even more surprising, my seat, which my ticket said was row 7, turned out to be row 2, as that section's first row was actually row 6. I couldn't believe how close I was. We were off to the side, a little towards the back, and right at the end of one side of the back walkway. There were times when Bruce was only 10 feet away from me. Badlands was great as the opener. The Ties That Bind I have not seen played much and was glad to see that one played. Spirit In The Night was fun as usual. A boy was on his father's shoulders on the floor, and Bruce reached way out over the audience to hold onto the boy's hand. Seeds and Johnny 99 I had never seen played before, so that was a highlight for me. I really wanted the hard rock Ghost Of Tom Joad next, but I knew it was already played the night before and we would get Youngstown in that slot. Raise Your Hand really had the audience up on participating in the shout out parts. I'm not thrilled about Bruce doing cover songs, but I have to say this song really worked and would like to see this song done again. Bruce came up on the back ramp for this, and was right by me singing it, and also came back by me when he sang Hungry Heart. The absolute highlight for me was Streets Of Philadelphia. I had only seen this song played one time before, 10 years ago the very first time I saw Bruce in concert. Starting with Radio Nowhere, Jay Weinberg sat in for the rest of the show. I was glad to get Thunder Road in the encore. I could do without the return of Land Of Hope And Dreams, and I think American Land could go. I'd rather see two old classics in that slot. At the end of the show it was nice to see Kitty's Back again. Overall it was an amazing experience, and I hope that I will one day get to be that close at a concert again.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Keith</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">GREAT SHOW!

I was also a little disappointed Bruce did not talk about playing there the night John Lennon was killed, as well as the night after because those shows were epic. Overall, still, a high-energy blast, one I was lucky enough again to score a ticket to in the parking lot 10 minutes before the show. Ties and Spirit were great. London Calling just blew the roof off the place! Powerful version. Red Headed Woman was fun, but after London Calling, Bruce needed another rocking song to keep things going as he lead the band into a glorious version of Thundercrack. Streets of Philadelphia was expected, but it would have been nice to have gotten E Street Shuffle or Racing in the Streets, something classic to make the show special. Thunder Road and Tenth were nice to hear back to back. Kitty's Back was amazing! Always a treat to hear this live. A terrific show without a doubt, but it never rose to the status of being a legendary show. Night 1 was, in my opinion.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

This show and the 7/31/2008 show at Giants Stadium could be the best shows I've seen since 1980- and I've seen quite a few.

Badlands and No Surrender were played with their usual intensity, as was a killer She's the One. Raise Your Hand just keeps getting better. Expressway to Your Heart was simply a fun song, done E Street Band style. A dead on For You was amazing and gave me my fourth song of my top ten I was hoping to hear this tour. Rendezvous and Night followed, making for a little mini-set of \"love\" songs and was without a doubt a highlight of the evening. I enjoy The Wrestler, just wish it was paired up with a classic, such as Racing or Backstreets. Not a big fan of Radio Nowhere and Lonesome Day is good, but lacks the impact of so many other fine songs. I wish Bruce would fit Lucky Day back into the set, right after Kingdom of Days and perhaps add Atlantic City or Cover Me with The Rising and BTR. A majestic, haunting Jungleland took the show to another level. It has to be one of the most emotionally, stunning and poetic songs he's ever written and I was worried I was not going to be fortunate enough to hear it. Thanks, Bruce. Dancing in the Dark? I was hoping this was not going to close the show and I guess Bruce sensed the crowd needed something a little more special after such a terrific show\u2014thankfully we got it as Bruce motioned for the band to keep playing as he launched into Rosie. The place went crazy, as expected. Enjoyed the show tremendously, as I always do, just wish Bruce would switch up that last quarter of the show a bit, be a little more flexible and spontaneous because afterall, that's all part of the enjoyment and magic of attending one of the shows, because it used to be, you never knew what you were going to get.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

The boss appeared on stage at about 8:15 and didn't finish until a little after 11. When I saw that this was his 4th show this week, I was a bit worried about him having the energy and the vocal cords to get through tonight's performance. However, Bruce did not let the crowd at lion's den down. During the recession trilogy, I couldn't help but notice that many of the fans used this time to either use the restroom or grab a refreshment. The first thing about the performance that really stood out to me was Nils solo on The Ghost of Tom Joad. I was not expecting the amazing view of the fretboard of Nil's guitar on the big screen as he was tearing through the solo. He had a small camera attached to the head of his guitar. During Raise Your Hand Bruce collected several signs from the audience. I couldn't help but notice several Lion's Den signs. Some of the signs that were displayed on the big screen were one with address of a party somewhere in the college town, and one that said \"fan since the womb\" (or something along those lines). Before playing My Generation, Bruce told the crowd \"The last time we played this song was\u2026.never, I think Steven might have played it in 1967.\" Although it was easy to tell the band had not rehearsed the song, the crowd really appreciated the energy that was put in the song and gave quite an applause after Bruce finished it off. Spirit In the Night had Bruce laying/crawling on the stage. He did the usual with Waitin' on a Sunny Day by having a younger audience member take one of the choruses. At one point during the show, Bruce explained how \"we are not going to rock the house tonight, but we are going to build a house. We are going to take the house of doubt, and build a house of faith, we are going to take the house of (fill in an appropriate negative word) and build a house of (fill in an appropriate positive word). Before playing the This Life, Bruce said \"Get the jingle bells ready bro.\" Also, before playing the song, he needed a moment to correctly place his voice in the right key. The song sounded great, but I'm not really sure that the crowd was into it. Before playing Hard Times, Bruce talked a bit about donating food to local food pantry at State College. Jungleland was definitely one of the highlights of the night! After Bruce finished, someone in the row behind me appropriately said, \"It doesn't get much better than that!\" I hope my rambling helps! Lol\u2026.Good night</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

However, I can honestly say that I have not seen a better arena concert. The band had been off a couple of days and the energy was impressive. The Boss and E street are pros and I have never seen a band act like they were so invested in the show. I personally think Badlands is a great opener because it jumps right into the meat of the song. I have never liked No Surrender as much as seeing it live. My girlfriend an admitted novice fan said that although she knew only a few songs would rate the show 9 on a 10 scale. We are both committed to seeing the next show that is close. Thanks Boss and E Street.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I'm Bruce's age and a 25+ year fan, so I can understand if he's kind of going through a nostalgia thing, but I don't want to see him become just another oldies act.

This one was a bit tricky being that I did not arrive in the parking lot until 7:50, without a ticket. But luckily, after a short search I ended up with a GA for $10 and entered as Badlands was starting. Bruce and band were definitely on. They made that transition from arena to stadium effortlessly. A great Spirit, Out in the Streets and early surprise of Twist &amp; Shout really kicked the show into high gear. Trapped was especially strong. Backstreets! What needs to be said? A classic! Last year's show was amazing, with an encore set that was a mini concert in its own right, but the only thing missing from last year's show was Backstreets. Thanks for playing it this time around. It gives Kingdom of Days a more powerful punch as both songs present the spectrum of life inside a relationship. I just don't understand why Backstreets is not played more often, or in fact, why it's not a staple in the show. It's strange that it appears every so often as a \"special\" song, when on other tours, Bruce played it on a regular basis. Hands down, one of his best songs ever and the crowd, no matter where, loves it. My opinion, keep it right there next to Kingdom of Days for a powerful 1-2 punch of something classic, paired with something new. The crowd was great! People were up all night, which definitely fueled Bruce's desire to give us his all. Energetic encore set with a great Thunder Road and 10th Avenue. He just needed a better song to end with than Bobby Jean. Ramrod or 7 Nights would have done the trick. Still, all in all, there's no other place I'd rather be than at a Springsteen concert, especially outdoors, beneath the stars on a summer-like night, hearing some of the best music ever.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Closest I have ever been and although I wasn't too thrilled about the setlist, after 25 shows, my proximity to the band made this one one special. It was a very meaningful night for me with regards to the long trip I have been taking with Bruce. Hadn't been to a Pittsburgh show in 9 years, and saw him 25 years ago in the same building. Plus it was 3 of my nieces and nephews 1st show but they weren't in pit with me. Jackson Cage and Like a Rolling Stone were the highlights for me, but this show to me was about Bruce's continued commitment and high energy and bringing the young people aboard, as I am taking my niece (who is now a rabid fan like me) to the Cleveland show in Nov.

What happened to Radio Nowhere? The Wrestler? I mean\u2026it was still a great time\u2026 but, I don't think it was one of his best outings.

I took my 7 yr old granddaughter to her first concert last night in the BURGH and it is a night she will never forget. After each concert I see, I pray he will be back again. I'm hoping after the Europe leg of his tour he will consider coming back. Would love to see him close to Christmas time-NO ONE WEARS A SANTA HAT LIKE THE BOSS. Rock on Bruce!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

The setlist was unspectacular but solid. I spent a lot of the show focused on Jay Weinberg. I have to agree with JJazznola that he has some work to do with his how smoothly he fits in with the band- it seems to me like he played over Clarence during the sax solo in Jungleland, but it was fun to watch Bruce direct Jay Weinberg through it. I think having Jay playing the set loosens things up a little, theres a little bit of that Seeger Sessions feel to it (I mean that in a good way) where Bruce is kind of directing Jay through the show at points where as with Max its more seemless. The kid is fantastic all in all. He absolutely carried Radio Nowhere and Seeds. He's up and down a little bit, but his highs I think are even better than Max's. I do have one complaint about the show, and most of you are going to think its sacreligious- the rendition of Rosalita that the band did was not very good. They didn't even play the bridge, which i think is the best part of the whole song. Its been turned into some communal sing along without all the great instrumental parts that make it a great song. Just my 2 cents.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">JJazznola</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">A decent show with no real surprises. I thought the Nassau show was a little better. It was cool to hear I'm Goin' Down. I do not remember hearing him play that one before. Jay played drums the entire show.

He is only 18 though.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Tom Cantillon</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">The Rock 'n' Roll gods have been very kind; 7 shows with no tickets before hand, and somehow, faith has been rewarded. Once again, up to the arena I go without a ticket and last night was a challenge. People, don't buy from the scalpers, it only drives the price up. At 8:05 I ran into a great group of college kids who had an extra ticket, which I scored for $50\u2014thanks guys! No real surprises, but still, a very high energy, kick-ass, pure E Street Band, Rocking show! It was amazing to get these classics: She's the One, Adam Raised a Cain, Prove it, Thunder Road and the epic Jungleland all in one show! Another highlight: Jay \u2014 Impressive! His drumming added some real power to Seeds, Prove it, I'm Goin' Down, Born to Run and Land of Hope &amp; Dreams \u2014 excellent job! Growin'Up \u2014 a stellar performance. The entire show was high octane and loose. Definitely one of the best Jersey shows I've seen them do in recent years. No fluff in the encores \u2014 great song choices. The college kids I sat with were great, into the show, appreciating it for what it's worth, enjoying it, unlike a lot of other folks who simply sat all night until Sunny Day. I don't get it? He plays a killer Adam, She's the One, a rollicking J99, a great little threesome of Growin' Up, I'm Goin' Down and Prove it, and yet they sat, until Sunny Day. Boggles me. The Hershey crowd was so much better, into the entire show, giving Bruce that energy back. Anyway, an amazing show for it being my 150th, but so far, Philly Night 1 holds top place of the few I've seen so far. Let's see what happens Saturday night.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Where did those barefoot street boys, lost souls and romantic young boys all go? What do they know? What have they seen? They through away their switchblade knives, so they have come to realize something that hopefully, Johnny will also. So many young men thinking they are Marlon Brando or James Dean, wearing their black, leather jacket like a second skin, identified by the hard look in their eyes that only masks their vulnerability and loneliness. You know you're hoping Johnny makes it, survives the concrete jungle to reunite with Jane down on Lover's Lane. Damn, he has to. She's counting on him. She moved over to share her pillow. Her heart hangs in the balance. Her hope is on that cross that probably hangs around her neck. Is her love for Johnny strong enough to rescue him from the underworld? What a damn fine song. A MASTERPIECE! Thankfully, I got to hear it. To experience it! \"Good night, it's all tight, Jane.\"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Tom Cantillon</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">What makes a Bruce Springsteen &amp; E Street Band concert so special? What keeps many of us coming back, time and time again? For those who have yet to experience one of their concerts, they just don't know. After 151 shows, I know I can only answer for myself. Why do I keep going back after all these years? First, his music has a way of ranscending everything else in one's life, even if for just those 3 hours you're at the concert. And that in itself is what makes the shows so uplifting and spiritually satisfying. For those few hours one is immersed in the music and the sheer energy, power and passion of the performance, it's enough to remove us from our ordinary lives and place us within all those wild and romantic beliefs that \"\"faith will be rewarded\"\". And sometimes that alone is enough. Sometimes that alone is enough to help us get through and continue forward and still believe. And there are very few other performers who can achieve such a feeling. It's a testament to Springsteen's undying commitment to give every audience, regardless of where they play, a concert that is not only filled with great music, but also provides a true spiritual salvation through something as simple as good, old fashioned rock 'n' roll. I've seen and enjoyed many other concerts, but have NEVER walked away from one feeling the way I do after an E Street Band performance. I can honestly say that I probably wouldn't be doing some of the things I do in my life had it not been for Springsteen and his music. His music is both universal and personal at the same time. In a crowd of 20,000, you can feel on any given night that he's playing just for you. It's weird, but true. His music gives hope. Hope for the simple things in life, like finding a job that doesn't drain the life out of you; having the tenacity not to give up on your dreams, regardless of what they might be; to finding that life-long partner you can ride down the highway with together as you both head for a brighter horizon. Springsteen's music, his performances, are that light at the end of the tunnel leading us all, we just have to be strong enough and optimistic enough to travel that distance despite \"the highway's jammed with broken heroes\", because seriously, what else is there to do? It's life! It comes around once. No Surrender! His music is there to remind us not to give up, to keep picking ourselves up and move forward. Move forward, even if it's just one step at a time. And his music is also about being celebratory once you've made that journey. Life is meant to be lived, to experience, not to simply be an observer. One must participate. It is the only way to get something back. That very passion he puts into each and every song and performance is there to remind us that we are to put that same passion into our lives. Blaze like a meteor. Streak across that night sky, because you never know who might be looking up. All I can say is that over the twenty-nine years of having Springsteen's music in my life and having seen his shows, I know that my life has been changed on many levels for the better. And for that, I have to thank Mr. Springsteen and E Street Band. You keep me believing, and that has made all the difference. As far as the show: Hands down, one of the best! Easily in my top 20. Got to meet Jay Weinberg outside before the show. A really nice guy and impressive drummer. Whereas on Thursday night, Bruce seemed to focus on Born to Run and Darkness, this was more of a Wild &amp; Innocent night. A real treat to get amazing versions of E Street Shuffle, the magnificent Incident on 57th Street and rockin' Kitty's Back! Powerful versions of Something in the Night, Seeds, Ghost, Cover Me and The Rising! Cover Me \u2014 fit it in with The Rising and Born to Run! Good Lovin'!! Amazing! Fun! Something he should definitely keep in the set because it's a blast. Glory Days and Mony Mony were great songs to rock out to and end one of the most amazing shows I've seen over the years. During several moments throughout the night, I really felt I was watching a band 20 years younger, giving their all. I don't know how he does it night after night. Springsteen is seemingly without a stop button, a rock 'n roll messiah bent on saving each and every last concert member. At least with me, he's succeeded. See you in the fall.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

There is also a great version of 'Racing' taken from close up , excellent footage and the full 9 minutes . A guy stood next to me turned and told me this was his absolute favourit Bruce song .

So did the band. First off, Bruce looks awesome and I think most of the band do too. Don't know how he does it but I sure hope I will be anywhere near his physical constitution when I am 59. Clarence is also amazing. Approaching 70, his playing is still extraordinary and his charisma as always unsurpassed. The venue was very nice and the front field tickets paid off as my girl and I had an excellent view on the stage and the giant screens. Sound was good. The audience was predominantely Swiss. That, of course, does not help the atmosphere \u2026 Don't know what it is with these Swiss people. But unless they are hard core fans they just cannot let loose. No singing or cheering before the concert (even though Bruce was 30 minutes late) and the sing along parts have surely been performed better by other audiences. During Thunder Road it was so bad that it actually cracked Bruce up. Song selection was very good despite the fact that there were no real surprises. What surprised me was that there were many people who apparently came to hear the new music and must have joined the fan community during the last 2-3 albums. Saw many people just not responding to classics such the pre-BITUSA stuff. Promised Land, Born to run, Johnny 99 did not get any reaction from people around me. First time I had that at a Bruce concert \u2026. took a lot of power from the Seeds/Johnny/Atlantic trio. My favorite memory: Bruce sharing vocals on \"Sunny Day\" with a little kid in front row. The kid got to sing 2 or 3 lines and got a lot of cheers from the crowd. Bruce joked \"I'll hire you and fire Steve\". Funny and touching at the same time. Will see him in Frankfurt on Friday and hope that the German crowd will be a better reward for the Boss. I don't know how he does it. The man is 59! My first concert on this tour and I think it was a very good performance. Bruce seemed to be fighting a cold but was in a very good mood.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I'm kinda mad at the moment. I just heard a lady on the radio (Tom Dunne - Newstalk) tell everyone about the wonderful experience her sons had at Bruce on Sat night.They \"waited all day\", the kids were \"huge fans\" (young boys maybe 7 and 5?). Bruce tried to get th eyoungest boy to sing during \"Waiting On A Sunny Day\". How great it all weas etc. What WASN'T mentioned weas how her and her pig ignorant husband hassled the fans around them, physically verbally and by putting those kids on their shoulders blocking eye lines for dozens of people behind them. Ignored rspectful AND official request to lower the children. The husband was a 6ft guy and bashed my 14 yr 4'11\" daughter in the head with his stupid back pack. Then the wife had the temerity to make snide/nasty comments to my girl when she told me what had happened and I asked the guy to be careful. I only found out this morning that my partner had also been elbowed in the jaw by the same guy (she hadn't told me on the night as tensions all around this pair was getting, sadly, raised). These folks were on a huge ego trip for themselves at the expense of everyone else. I'm delighted the child got to high five Bruce (after he was practically thrown at him) but this couple were shameful in their lack of respect for anyone else. The kids btw were bored, sleepy, whiney, fidgety for 95% of the show (as kids will be, not their fault - standing in the rain for 12 hours will do that to ya!)We didn't let this spoil our show though and had a great time. I was just so annoyed hearing this mother on the radio tell everyone how wonderful it was etc when she obviously hadn't a clue/didn't care about anyone else around her including other peoples kids. Shame on them. No one wins unless everyone wins. The amount of other great people from around the globe we met that evening confirmed that Bruce fans are a special breed.

The misery of standing and waiting in the elements for the gig to begin is soon forgotten. The Boss is here and he?s here to stay for 10 minutes shy of 3 hours!! Following the opening song, the set takes a more familiar sound as Badlands, Cover Me, Because the Night &amp; Born to Run are all included in a fantastic range from Bruce?s Encyclopaedia of music. So many highlights were crammed into the near 3 hour set, something for everyone. Whether it was the wee toddler helping out with Waiting on a Sunny Day, the brilliance of taking requests from the jubilant crowd or the musical highlights which confirm that this man and his merry band provides unbelievable and unforgettable performances night after night. In particular tonight the performances of The River, Thunder Road and The Ghost of Tom Joad stick out, but the list is endless and everyone has their favorites. The July 11th show will go down as one of my all time favourite Bruce gigs, having seen him 11 times, last nights show had energy that I haven?t seen before from a Springsteen performance. Because of the poor weather conditions he had to work harder than ever to keep the crowd interested, it?d have been very easy for anyone to walk out of a gig early having stood for hours in the lashing rain, but this wasn?t just any gig this was the self proclaimed ?hardest working? Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. Was leaving an option for anyone? No chance. We were there to see a show and a show is what we got. There was no need for mechanical elephants, uni-cyclists, clowns or trapeze artist (Take That- Croke Park).

It definitely is the worst venue in Scotland. The stage is positioned there because there are 'debenture holders' seats in the main stand opposite so they have the best seats. They are guaranteed tickets for any event, football (international or club), concerts, whatever. This also affects the sound - the echo effect. Here's hoping the 'stadium wrecker' )Twist and Shout) did it's job. Bruce, when you come back to Scotland go to either Murrayfield, Ibrox or Parkhead.As always the show was fantastic.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Geraint</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">An AWESOME gig - best ever Bruce gig for me, topping even Roundhay Park.

I'd made a request sign before we left (were here where the f*** is Rosie) and after getting right up front against the stage, to our joy Bruce took it from my daughter, who was on my shoulders holding it aloft, but to our dismay he played 2 or 3 requests. Then went back to the setlist but things were going to get a whole lot better. He next went into promised land and towards the end he made his way to our side of the stage, and after finishing the harmonica riff, he bent down and placed it in my daughters hand tussled her hair and kissed her cheek. The three of us went absolutely mental as did the crowd all around us. The icing on the cake came in the encore when he picked our sign up, showed it to the band, then turned towards where we were stood and shouted are you still here, and then proceeded to nail Rosie. The harmonica now takes pride of place in our house, a treasured memory of a fantastic concert and holiday, plus he's now got 2 new converts.

Many performers are more hype than substance so I tempered my expectations despite hearing that his live shows were exceptional. How wrong I was, and I must admit that I now regret waiting so long to see him. Although he's an aging geezer like me, he exhibits the energy of a 20 year old. The chemistry he has with his audience and the attention he pays to them during his 3 hour marathon are incredible. This guy really enjoys what he's doing and is genuinely affectionate toward his fans. You can't fake that sort of thing for 3 straight hours. In addition, his band was very tight. All are exceptional individual musicians who function like a single organism. I tip my hat to him and his band. They are truly an American institution.

He resonnates to the whole crowd. Simply amazing. When you take your children to a show, you realize that the new material does have value and they connect with that better. While they like the traditional stuff like Promised Land, BTR, Thunder Road and Badlands; they also really get into Waiting on a Sunny Day, The Rising and Outlaw Pete. I guess the new material does have merit. Having seen him 14 times now, I was wondering if I would see stuff that I have never seen before (other than the new cover segment which I love). Well I had never seen him do Growin Up, Independence Day, Janey and Saint in the City - so there was something for me. The true hightlight is when he breaks into Thunder Road when you don't expect it. Another highlight for me was Prove It All Night. I think I have seen that song at least a dozen times but never in the middle of the show. When I looked over and saw my daughter Rachel really grooving to Nils solo, I knew that the night was a huge success.

There was something magical about hearing it cover to cover; it just made you present to the absolute greatness of the album. Yes, it was done with somewhat \"album versions\" but it was very passionate and powerful. Thunder Road, Backstreets and Jungleland were all amazing but Meeting Across The River really did it for me (and I heard it last year in Milwaukee with Richard as well). Last night though, it was so freaking cool; the original bass as well as just an outstanding trumpet throughtout. I've always loved Meeting and I've always believed it to be one of Bruce's most underrated songs. Well last night proved me right again (as always my wife would say). Just amazing. The rest of the night was also great; extremely energetic and the crowd interplay was actually the best I have ever seen in my 27 shows. Bruce in the pit 100 fans deep, wow.Never seen that before, ever! Bringing all those kids up to sing and dance! On the lip of the stage half the night it seemed. OK, I could have picked a better setlist (a lot of the songs were either too predictable such as The Rising, etc. or songs I would not pick to hear such as Seeds, Goin Down and about 5-6 others, at least) but hey I don't get to pick the setlist (too bad for you all) so the complaint is very minor compared to the greatness of the evening.

The Band had never played it previously, but it seemed a natural for them (what with the made-for-Clarence sax solo and the wall-of-sound sound), so we gave our request sign a try.

Right out of the gate they launched into 'Seeds,' jumped right into 'No Surrender,' and whipped the pit into a frenzy with 'Johnny 99.' Bruce laughed off a kind of sloppy 'Working on a Dream,' (which is kind of a throwaway song at the point) and then got down to business. Hard to believe that in 1975 'Born to Run' was the band's make or break album. Fortunately for all of us it cemented his career and for anyone who attended his concerts from the mid-70's his decision to play the album in its entirety is such a welcome decision. Every word, every note has a special meaning. Last night in Chicago Bruce and the band played each song with such feeling and reverence I was feeling somewhat alarmed that he was trying to tell his audience something. Let's hope not. From the opening strains of 'Thunder Road' to the closing roar of 'Jungleland' Bruce took his audience for an amazing ride. And that was just the first half of the 3-plus hour show. The band's energy was met head-on by the crowd's enthusiasm and the nearly blew the roof off the UC. By the time 'Rosalita' was put to bed we were drained and energized at the same time. Bruce: 60 and still slaying the crowds.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Wrecking Ball was a great opening song \u2014 meaningful and hard rockin'. Seeds, J99 and Atlantic City worked well as a powerful trio. The treat of the evening came with the entire Born to Run album taking center stage and being played with all the ferocity and heart that went into making it. The entire collection of songs are flawless, filled with all the romance, love, hope, drama, tragedy and majesty every poet and songwriter has attempted to capture, but just weren't sure how to. Wednesday night, Bruce and band proved that without a doubt, they had captured it, the essence of life in 8 songs, and there will never be another album like it. When the 70s was filled with a lot of soft rock that offered nothing salvational, Born to Run came along, demanding attention, well-deserved attention. It's an epic collection about a journey through life we will all take, a journey not unlike that of Homer's classics, where man fights against fate and forces that are seemingly beyond his control as he tries to find out just who he is in this vast and seemingly indifferent world. From the opening notes of Thunder Road, to the closing wails of Jungleland, we are all there, struggling and rooting for the characters, because we see ourselves in them, in those songs, in those stories and that's what makes them universal masterpieces\u2026they are the songs of Everyman! Hearing the songs in sequence, the epic Backstreets and Jungleland gave me chills. A hard-rockin' She's the One drove the crowd wild! Into the Fire worked much better than Radio Nowhere ever did, as it helped to bring forth that spiritual quality of the Rising songs, especially as it lead into Lonesome Day and then The Rising itself. A touching moment in the stadium as Bruce played those 3 songs and everyone was up, dancing, remembering, paying tribute to the fallen, but also celebrating life itself. Encores time Bruce gave his long time fans a treat as he gave us a high-energized E Street Shuffle and comical Growin' Up, not to mention an uplifting Hard Times and the ever entertaining, crowd pleaser \u2014 Rosie. Easily one of the best shows I've seen them present. They get better with age \u2014 it's true. They are tight and professional and having the time of their life; thanks for taking us all along with you. The songs never grow old, the music never fails to inspire.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Bruce came out rockin' and started with \"Wrecking Ball\" although no words were on the screen for us to singalong. He just kep going at a feverish pace with the smiling and cajoling that made us all believe that this would be a special night. DARKNESS rose over Giants Stadium and it was pure magic. From the first few notes, every song was nailed perfectly and we all wondered how life could be in any better in Bruce-land. For me, the anticipation of knowing that I would hear \"Somewhere in the Night\" and \"Racing in the Street\" provided an inner peace of sorts. \"Racing\" was never better as The Professor kept taking us higher and higher with his beautiful and articulate piano solo mid-song. Even Bruce was smiling knowing that Roy was on another plateau in that moment. The night kept going with rarely played, but beloved songs like \"Be True\" and \"Long Walk Home\" - and a strong encore was imminent. Thank goodness that I found out after the show that my favorite live song \"Kitty's Back\" was replaced by a two-some of \"Cadillac Ranch\" and \"Dancin'\" - they were more crowd pleasers, although the \"afficionados\" will always long for Kitty (and, he did play it the next night!!) - so, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band is home. No drizzle of rain (although it looked like snow in the lights of Giants Stadium) could upset our Friday night dancefest. What a band, what a night! Forever friends\u2026rap \"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Tom Cantillon</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">In the summer that I was baptized, my father held me to his side\u2026 Darkness! Complete! Unbelievable! Probably my favorite show of the 5 night stand, with night #4 a very close 2nd. This was also a highlight of the over 150 shows I've seen over the years. An amazing performance. A mini concert all its own. Adam Raised a Cain was chilling and powerfully played. Something in the Night was simply haunting and beautiful, in a heartbreaking way. \"We tried to pick up the pieces and get away without getting hurt, but they caught us at the state line, and burned our cars in one last fight, and left us running burned and blind, chasing something in the night\". The images conjured by that stanza haunt you long after the song is over\u2026just amazing! The entire song plays out like a movie you'd have seen in the 70s, something real and gritty and not afraid to be a dark and somewhat bleak, because that's the real world, at times. The most beautifully played Racing in the Streets, which is sad also, in its own way, leaves one feeling a little more optimistic and Roy simply moved both the song and audience into another world. One of my all time favorites and least played songs. Blistering versions of Streets of Fire and Prove it just were out of control before closing with an intense Darkness. To have gotten the entire album played from start to finish was without a doubt, a highlight of just about any show I've seen. I see that for the remainder of the tour it looks like mostly Born to Run, minus the one night in Philly, but boy, does this one need to be played more often. A true classic with not a weak track in its collection. I know Born in the USA was his most popular, but damn, nothing is ever going to top Darkness or Born to Run and more fans should be treated to the entire Darkness album. A rocking Jailhouse Rock took everyone by surprise and was a great addition to an already fantastic show. Thunder Road and a rousing Long Walk Home also helped to keep the main set moving along without a lull. The encores started off promising with Cadillac Ranch, but went flat after that. Best encores were probably night 3 and 5. Hands down though, one of the best main sets and a true treat to have gotten one of the most poetic, intense and powerful albums ever written. Hoping at least one night at the Garden will get this gem.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

My wife, Ang, was really looking forward to this one, so after scoring really cheap GAs and getting pretty close, we had a blast dancing and singing all night. Cover Me was amazing! Nils' guitar solos are out of this world. I'm on Fire was another highlight. Long Walk Home is a great addition to the main set, working much better than Lonesome Day or Radio Nowhere. Heartfelt, rollicking, intense, playful encores with Jersey Girl, a brilliant Kitty's Back and hard-stomping Detroit Medley sent the already enthusiastic crowd into a frenzy. And to close with Thunder Road was simply an amazing way to cap off an amazing night of music.

The addition of these 4 songs took the show to another level, but then, to get Fourth of July in the encores and Twist and Shout after Rosie, firmly planted this show at the #2 spot of the 5 nights at GS.

Extended jams on Cover Me, Working on the Highway and Glory Days were all amazing. It was great to finally get Spirit in the Night; been waiting for that one. Took a while to score some cheap ticks, but finally got some GAs for $30 and got in plenty of time to get close and enjoy the show. Tougher than the Rest \u2014 nice choice. Killer Long Walk Home! Great encores: Staring us off with Raise your Hand, before blasting into the Stones' Last Time, 7 Nights to Rock and easily one of the best versions of Kitty's Back \u2014 rockin' and jamming as they kept the stadium crowd on their feet. Jersey Girl \u2014 a beautiful version, truly heartfelt, but was hoping for Thunder Road or Travelin' Band to close the show. Been a memorable 5 nights at Giants Stadium: Cheap parking lot ticks for the floor every night, great crowds, a real treat to hear 3 albums in their entirety, especially Born to Run and Darkness, and what better way to spend a night than in the swamps of Jersey listening to the greatest Rock 'n' Roll band play their hearts out. Thanks Kyle and Illya for the overall fun, especially with trying to score cheap ticks at the last minute \u2014 and always being successful. And a special thanks to Ang, for coming along for the ride and for living with your Bruce nut of a husband. Sad to see the shows come to an end, but thankful for having been able to be there and experience a part of rock 'n' roll history!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

The surprises and rarities were the opener \"Seaside Bar Song\", \"The Fever\", \"This Hard Land\" and \"Because The Night\".

Stellar performances by everyone. Went in thinking I wasn't going to enjoy CNY, but they were very good. Working with Jackson Browne and Bonnie Raitt really added to the portion of their show. Their songs set the theme for the night about how universal, meaningful and important music is as a whole as it not only allows for us to have a good time, but also reflects upon what's happening in our society and world and how it effects all of us. Timeless and essential. The video clips helped visually to highlight the overall theme that each group and performer must have felt as they landed on stage and presented their chosen songs. Simon &amp; Garfunkel were amazing! One of the highlights of the evening was listening to them sing Sounds of Silence and Bridge Over Troubled Water. During their set, which also included Dion and Little Anthony and the Imperials, you got a sense that the show was not only about showcasing talented musicians and celebrating music, but also about celebrating how New York contributed to those particular artists and their sounds. In a way, indirectly, it also felt a little like a concert that was there to still add a little healing to us all after the 9/11 tragedy. Stevie Wonder, along with BB King, John Legend, Jeff Beck and Sting all did an outstanding job grooving and rocking to those old Stevie Wonder classics \u2014 a real treat getting to see him perform. Loved Higher Ground, Superstition and even his heartfelt tribute to Michael Jackson. A genuine moment that made the night even more special. Then came Springsteen thundering on stage with a rousing 10th Avenue, followed by high octane versions of Hold On and Soul Man, as Sam Moore joined him \u2014 amazing performance. A seering Ghost was followed by hard-rockin' versions of Fortunate Son and Proud Mary, with Fogerty adding some muscle to the performance. Bruce and Fogerty paired up for a fantastic tribute to Roy Orbison with a stellar Pretty Woman. Jungleland \u2014 a supercharged, passionate version! Darlene Love joined the band for some fun times before Bruce got gritty again with a fantastic London Calling and blistering Badlands. Billy Joel joined the band for a few tunes, one being a jazzy, passionate New York State of Mind, before launching into a rocking Born to Run and over-the-top performance of Higher and Higher. 6 hours later, I left feeling I'd been to not only a rock show, but a night that celebrated all the good things about music and its ability to change the lives of those who listen to it. The artists celebrated that New York atmosphere in all its glory, but also paid tribute to a city that has seen both its triumphs and sorrows, yet remains a source of inspiration from those early doo wop groups, to the romanticism and hard-rocking tunes of Bruce and Joel and all those who have come in between and will continue to come and produce music that truly matters.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

It is not uncommon to read long time fans claim that you haven't seen Bruce Springsteen at his peak unless you saw him [during some early tour they witnessed]. I think this is arrogant nonsense. I have seen multiple shows on every tour since Darkness in 1978 - Charlotte was number 58 - and I have never seen anyone, including Bruce, play more intense or better shows. than those he is doing now. I walked out of the Fox Theater in Atlanta on September 30, 1978 and the arena in Charlotte last Tuesday night feeling exactly the same way; that I had just experienced the greatest rock &amp; roll that has ever been or ever will be. Obviously the shows are different. Hell, I'm different. The shows in late April in Atlanta and early May in Greensboro with different than the Charlotte show, different in many ways *except* their sheer, stunning greatness. It's no longer the, \"Working on a Dream\" tour. Only the albums title song was played. The tour is now grander than that. Born to Run, the album, one of the most magnificent achievements in Rock, was absolutely perfect. Not one note was out of place. As great as the songs on the album, the whole is much more than the sum of those songs. It is easy to forget this when hearing the songs piecemeal. Every song was made better by being played in the original sequence, She's the One is a different and far better experience when it followed Born to Run, the song; Jungleland has never sounded better than when following Meeting Across the River (which I had never heard live). The arena was not sold out and if ever there was a show through which to coast a little, this could have been the one. Bruce doesn't know how to coast. I don't think he could do it if he tried. Intended or not, for me, the show had a feeling of finality, as if Bruce realizes this *might* be the last Big E-Street Band Rock Tour. I doubt if he knows for sure, but if it is, he's taking the band out with a bang, with special shows, trancendental shows, that those there will never forget. I hope that we soon have professional videos of these performances. Nothing can ever match being there, but even with the limitations of television, I think everyone deserves to see shows like Charlotte.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Wow! \"Sparks fly on E Street when the boy prophets walk it handsome and hot\u2026\" and man, did sparks fly tonight in the Garden as Bruce and band lit up the place with a phenomenal performance of The Wild, Innocent and E Street Shuffle. A rousing Thundercrack opened the show, followed by a seering Seeds and Prove it all Night. But once Bruce and band settled into the E Street Shuffle, complete with horns, the place was groovin' and ready for the ride, and what a ride they gave us. A beautiful Fourth of July led into one of the most energized performances of Kitty's Back I've ever seen them do\u2014they just kept on rockin' it and jazzing it up to another whole level. Easily one of the best renditions of Incident they've ever done. The song is a romantic masterpiece from start to finish and they played it as such. The band just flowed with it, making those dark, secretive, street corners of New York come alive with the plight of the 2 young lovers. A rousing Rosey led into a captivating version of New York City Serenade, complete with a string section that was hauntingly beautiful and a highlight of the evening. The performance of just the album itself will be remembered as an epic moment in the cataloge of Springsteen performances. Words are inadequate to faithfully describe that section of the concert. Does this Bus Stop fit nicely with the theme of the show, as did a smoldering Human Touch. But the encores were somewhat uninspiring. There are so many great tunes that would make for a great encore and I just don't understand why the same Bobby Jean and Dancing have to be played. Mix it up more. Throw in 10th Avenue, Light of Day, Stand on It or even All Shook Up, which was so much fun down in Philly. Higher and Higher was great, but by then, so much of the initial energy had vanished that it was hard to get the Garden back to that glorious moment in which we all felt a little Wild, Innocent and E Street Shuffle magic.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

It was fantastic! It was my 11th concert and simply one of the best. To hear the whole River album was just a dream come true. So many songs I never heard before at a concert. The sound was so clear, I had goosebumps all over during Fade Away and especially Drive all night. It was also interesting to attend a Bruce show in the States and compare it to Europe: The fans are much more into it in Europe, there's much more dancing and clapping in Europe. But at MSG the people all new the lyrics much better than in Europe. Also the fans in Europe are in average much younger which explains why there is more dancing and partying in Europe. All in all a fantastic experience that I will never ever forget. Hopefully we get a DVD from that show.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Ralph</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">The River. THE RIVER! The entire album. What a night. Bruce played this for the only time ever - \"and never again\" - as he said that \"it takes too long to play\". After another opening with \"Wrecking Ball\", Bruce went right into The River album. It was historic. As prepared to play the rockers, ballads and epics, he told a long story about how much the album meaned to him and \"how he wanted to develop characters in this album that he would bring back in other albums\". It was Bruce telling stories in a night which would take well over three hours and nearly 30 songs in length. Bruce was masterful. Yeah, we had \"Sherry\" and \"Crush\" and \"Jackson\", but we had \"Fade Away\", \"The River\", Independence Day\" and other ballads. \"Marry You\" was special - and you could just feel the emotion as retold the story of young love. But, it was side four. Oh, Side Four! After \"Ramrod\", we tightened our seatbelts and endured the emotions of \"The Price You Pay\", \"Drive All Night\" and \"Wreck on the Highway\". Wow. Bruce usually takes me on the rollercoaster ride. Up emotionally, down emotionally, a little fun, a little retrospection, more fun, etc. Tonight, there was no show for me emotionally after \"Price/Drive/Wreck\". I was done - and so were a lot of my friends. Not since the New Year's Eve show at Nassau Coliseum (also in NY) on December 31, 1990 had I heard those three songs - and certainly not in their natural order. How can I describe it? Now, 29 years later from when these songs were released, they meant so much more to me. I have grown into these songs and my story has become the stories in the songs. Life has endured. Dear members of my family and friends have passed on. Love has been found, and lost, and has become complicated. The light that shines ahead is flickering and the world has changed - and is still changing. While, to me, \"Born to Run\", is Bruce's best album, due to the perfection of eight amazing songs, Side Four will always be my favorite - make that, most critical - side of any of Bruce's album sides. Maybe more so than any album side from any other artist. After Side Four, I was done. It's almost 2:00am and I have to tell the world that this was one of the most emotional, yet enduring, nights of my life. I have now heard it once - maybe the only time played - but, I do not think that I could sit through Side Four again. Once is enough. Once was almost too much. Bruce was so in tune with this album tonight and the extraordinary E Street Band was so good. More so than ever. There were some references to Danny (although Charlie did not miss a note tonight) and I could not help but think of Terry (they broke the mold). It was a great night. An essential night. Played once. Bruce, if you do see this note, please accept my thanks for doing these albums. They mean so much to us - especially in today's world. There are a lot of disciples out here that believe that The Promised Land is always just around the bend. And, you know something, it always is\u2026</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Tom Cantillon</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Now with their hands held high they reached out for the open skies\u2026 THE RIVER\u2014From start to finish! Breathtaking. Riveting. Mind blowing. Unmatched. From reckless rockers such as Cadillac Ranch, Crush on You and Ramrod, to heartfelt songs about love, desperation, risks and death within such classics as Independence Day, Point Blank, Stolen Car, Price You Pay, Wreck on the Highway and the epic love poem, Drive all Night, this was a show unlike any other. Without a doubt, easily in my top 3 because the show was off the charts from start to finish. There are a few artists whose music can reach deep into their listeners and make lifelong connections that in some instances, are even life-altering. Bob Dylan, of course. The man's music is timeless, a reflection of humanity's soul, both divine and depraved. The Stones, with their British-blues tinged songs of love and lust played with a real bad-boy attitude. And then there's Springsteen, with a catalog of songs that reach deep to our very core, asking questions about the life we live, the dreams we have, the places we travel, the love we share with the connections we all make thru our own personal journeys. This was the first album, The River, that spoke to me on many levels. I remember while attending art school and working late at night on various art projects, I'd put The River album on my turntable and play it nonstop, sometimes till dawn. And there I sat, drawing and painting, creating images that were both directly and subconsciously effected by this collection of songs. I remember listening to the River, it's lyrics filled with heartbreak over the realization of the death of one's own dream and nothing seemed more frightening. The dark poetic imagery in Stolen Car and Drive all Night inspired much of my own art and writing because they were so honest, so down to the bone real and powerful that one couldn't help but be moved. And then of course there were moments in which to celebrate, to dance and rock all night because it simply felt like the right thing to do. Ramrod, You Can Look, I'm a Rocker and Crush on You are moments of joyous celebration embedded in the foundation of all good rock songs \u2014 thanks to Chuck Berry. This collection of songs spoke to me in a way no other music ever had up to this point in my life. And when I saw my first Springsteen concert, December 8th 1980, the man, the performance, the music and the lyrics were a life-altering moment that I am forever grateful for. It was like attending a concert in which the souls of Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly, Elvis, the Beatles, Woody Guthrie and Dylan all came together for one unbelievable night of music. As the River segment finished that night at MSG, Bruce was obviously on a high and delivered a powerhouse of songs with Atlantic City, followed by Badlands \u2014 right into Born to Run \u2014 which I was hoping for at least one night \u2014 and then into a rip-roaring 7 Nights. The energy level was astounding! The magic continued with a revved-up Sweet Soul Music, manic No Surrender, a surprise I Can't Falling in Love and the hand-clapping sing-along of Jackie Wilson's Higher and Higher, which was the perfect way in which to end this show because Bruce and band had taken us all higher and higher that evening, all the way to the end and there was no place left to go. Except maybe out to the streets of New York to rock 'n' roll till the break of dawn. Thanks Mr. Springsteen and E Street Band for finally delivering the entire River collection, something I've waited for a long time. Hopefully, this show will be released as a DVD or CD because for the fans who were not there, they definitely missed a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to witness a monumental collection of songs played with all the energy, sincerity and passion that only New Jersey's true street poet could do.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

It was bizarre for him to call Detroit \"Ohio\" a few times but he playfully acknowledged he didn't know where he was at. The setlist was solid although as someone who is from Detroit I don't think Bruce needed to remind us of MI's economic malaise by playing hard times, Johnny 99. Hearing Born To Run was absolutely spectacular, it's such a great album. I was surprised that Waiting On A Sunny Day wasn't played after Jungleland, but hearing Working on the Highway and Raise Your Hand was great. The requests were purely Detroit, with Bruce covering Bob Seger's Ramblin' Gambling Man, Detroit Medley &amp; Because the Night, which is a great song. I could have done without Lonesome Day as I was hoping for Long Walk Home but to close the main set with The Rising &amp; Badlands was awesome. The encore was great, the audible for Born In The USA was tremendous, such a great song. To close out the show with Dancing In The Dark, Rosalita, Higher &amp; Higher was simply wonderful.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Don</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Took the girlfriend to see Bruce for the first time, my 19th time. She was very excited and pumped, like me. The first 3 songs to open the show just got her going even more. A flying start to say the least. During Hungry Heart and his body surfin' thru the pit, she couldn't believe it. I let her borrow the Born To Run album her get her acquainted with the songs and when he broke out with Thunder Road, she was ready. She thought it was funny when he kept calling Detroit Ohio, but every front man's worst nightmare came true for Bruce. But in true Bruce fashion, he made it up to the crowd by feeding off the goof up. He sure can turn a negative in a positive in a hurry. It was almost like he did it on purpose just to get the crowd that much more pumped. The request sure made up for the mistake with Detroit's own Bob Seger's Ramblin' Gamblin' Man, and the always crowd pleaser Detroit Medley. The way Bruce can play an old song right into a newer one, well he just might be the best at it. To go from Because The Night into Lonesome Day and The Rising back into Badlands without a pause truly sets himself apart. It was like he wrote them all in the same day. The encore was none stop energy and a great way to say 'sorry'.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Bruce and band were at the top of their game tonight and loving it. Blistering Prove it All Night came early before a stellar performance of the Born to Run album. A beautiful Thunder Road led into a high-energy 10th Ave and Night. Then came a truly magnificent version of Backstreets, rising in intensity with each stanza. A high-powered Born to Run crashed into a smoking She's the One! By this time, they were on fire and we were all happily burning with them. During meeting you couldn't hear another sound. Then Jungleland exploded and the whole world disappeared! I am so glad I got the chance to see this classic album performed one last time, an experience all its own. Bruce made some very smart choices next, which made the show even better. Sometimes you go to the show and have to worry if the momentum is suddenly going to drop because of a particular song choice, but Bruce chose well this night. A killer Spirit took us all down to Greasy Lake for some midnight loving. A very loose, groovy Green Onions was a surprise, which took us into a fun-filled Santa and stomping E Street Shuffle. Next, another surprise and great choice, For You on piano! A highlight of the evening with a doubt. Standing there watching Bruce perform this, I felt as if I were in the arena by myself bearing witness to a truly intimate moment. Bravo! Radio Nowhere was ok, but the hard-driving My Love shifted the show into overdrive; another excellent choice by Bruce as his performer instincts took over. A powerful Long Walk was another highlight \u2014 just amazing. By the time Badlands came along, I was surprised the place was still standing. Ramrod \u2014 another great choice, but oddly placed. I think if he'd played Hard Times, Land and American Land first, then tore into Ramrod, Dancing, Rosie and Higher, the energy level would have shot us all into the stratosphere. Getting ready to leave, I watched Bruce and Clarence hug and share the moment, which was very touching, then Bruce ran over and began waving frantically for his guitar because it was time for another one, Glory Days, with a little Louie, Louie kicked in to send us home rocking into the night and realizing this was truly one of the best damn shows of the tour! Over 160 shows down the road and this tour has easily been the best thing they've done in the past 10 years. Playing classic albums night after night helped to create some very memorable shows. Night 1 at GS, hearing the Born to Run album for the first time start to finish was unbelievable. Night 2 with a smoking Darkness set was a highlight. A magnificent performance of Wild, Innocent &amp; E Street Shuffle at MSG was jaw dropping. And my favorite show of the tour and easily in my top 3 of all shows \u2014 The River night at MSG. That show left me speechless and high for over a week. Sorry I missed Buffalo, would have really liked to have seen the last tour show. But at least I caught this one in Baltimore and am glad I did. Thanks Bruce and band once again for saving our rock 'n' roll souls and giving, me, us, your fans, many, many nights of amazing rock 'n' roll memories. Enjoy the break. Write some new material. We look forward to seeing YOU AND THE E STREET BAND soon, further on down the road.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

After 3 and a half hours you still want more. But all good things must come to an end. I spent the next 5 hours driving home wondering just maybe that Bruce and the boys can't go any higher. They have hit all cylinders and climbed that mountain and reached the peak. After almost 40 years of perfecting their craft, they are the true masters of Rock And Roll.

Always a Friend was accompanied by Bruce and beautifully done. Bruce's set with Joey G and Houserockers was a raucous good time. Hard-driven performances of Atlantic City, Adam Raised a Cain and Darkness were definite crowd pleasers. I was thrilled to get to hear 2 tracks from the Promise disc; One Way Street was captivating and Save My Love was terrific, definitely songs that should appear on the next tour. Pink Cadillac, always been one of favorites and Bruce just had a blast with this bluesy version. Promised Land and Light of Day were high energy versions and Bruce capped the night off with a touching acoustic Thunder Road, a perfect way to end a great night of music for a great cause.<br/>\nSee you all next year.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

The harmony was amazing. I don't think I'll ever forget when I heard the first few notes of American Skin, I didn't think I'd ever have the chance to hear that live, since it seemed like it had it's time and place. I had mentioned it to the kids sitting next to me, before the show, how in some ways it's one of my favorite recordings. You can hear him breath on it, for god's sake!! Emotionally breath!! And the respectful, to the audience, way he said \"we need some quiet\" anyway, I knew instantly, as did everyone around me, that it was a trayvon tribute. But maybe one of the top ten emotional highs I have ever had in my life was the way he stopped 10th Avenue Freeze Out. it was insane. You could feel something HUGE and like being a part of something that had a connection to the other side, you just knew we reached the other side. I'm sure it happens every night. I cried three times, the first time, I tried to hide it: if you're here, and we're here, they're here. The second two times, American Skin, and 10th Avenue, I just gave up, and bawled, and loved it</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Nicely slotted throughout the night were some very perfect choices of older songs: Night, Prove It, Darkness, Trapped and the delirious Thundercrack! The threesome of The Rising, We Are Alive and Thunder Road builds upon the overall theme of the show: those who have passed on, who have made their contributions to this world, their spirit lives on within those of us who continue to do the same. And to add Thunder Road, a song about taking chances and living in the moment, as well as reminding us all of the contributions of Clarence, that was simply perfect! Easy Money was the only song I was not crazy about. Would have prefered You've Got It or even an acoustic 2 Hearts for Bruce and Patty. Kitty rocked and swaggered as usual. Most touching moment, definitely 10th Ave. Bruce stops the song after singing, \"When the Big Man joins the band\". And when he dances across the stage alone, without his musical companion there to emphasize the importance of that friendship,it leaves a pang in your heart. A terrific show start to finish, with a sincere tribute to the Big Man. Keep on rockin' hard!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

We Take Care of Our Own, Wrecking Ball, Badlands! and Death to My Hometown simply knock your socks off and as you're staggering to regain yourself, Bruce and band level you with So Young and in Love and a whirlwind E Street Shuffle! You're about spent by then, but he's not finished with you, not by a long shot. He's looking to pour some potent rock and roll into your soul and give you a reason to keep pumping your fist, stomping your feet, singing until your throat is raw. Turned the place into cinders after Seeds and Prove It All Night. Channeling Sam Cooke, Otis, Wilson Pickett and James Brown, Bruce and band launch into a cool-cat medley of soulful tunes that puts you in the backseat of any car on a hot Saturday night with windows all steamed and the promise of that one very real moment. Bring on some more of that cool-cat strut with the likes of Midnight Hour, Hold On, Chain Gang, Mustang Sally, Sweet Soul Music\u2026 Nils ripped the roof off the joint with Because the Night, taking no prisoners as he shredded every note deep into the very marrow that holds us mere mortals together! Big Man! You are missed, brother, definitely missed, but Jake can hold is own and Bruce and band do the Big Man justice by highlighting many songs that C claimed as his own and gave to us as he blew his sax high from Mt.

Seeds and Prove It were blistering, firey versions, full of fury. The new material keeps sounding better live. Love Jack of All Trades and We Are Alive. Wrecking Ball is filled with many great songs that have brought the band and this tour some new energy. The new songs fit well with Bruce's catalog, especially alongside the material from Darkness and The River. Would love to hear Price You Pay, Something in the Night and Stolen Car. The Apollo Medley is great. Nice tribute to the music that has inspired Bruce to carry on the tradition as the white James Brown. 41 Shots, an intense, powerful song. Because the Night was out of control once Nils turned loose. Keep that in the set every night! Out in the Street was a good addition to the encores, getting everyone up and singing before leading us thru Born to Run, Dancing and an amazing 10th Ave.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

There is a special place in Bruce's heart for every city on the tour, but Detroit goes all the way back to September 23\u00a01975 with his first appearance in the area in Ann Arbor for his 26 year old birthday show. So with the addition of Badlands, Incident, Youngstown and Thunder Road to a politically and socially charged set list, Bruce almost levitated the Palace.

Now we're really close through music, and we both agree The Boss cannot be beat. If Springsteen doesn't win the Grammy for best rock performance, there has got to be something wrong with this world.

So I forced myself not to watch the setlists of the in between shows anymore, to keep up the expectations for the show in Florence. That was a good decision, it worked, although the setlist wasn't too special - until Backstreets came, one of my alltime favorite Bruce songs. From that song on I was so pumped and happy that even the heavy rain didn't bother me. But of course what made that show so special was the deluge that came upon us from midshow on. The show started with Badlands at exactly 20:29 and with it the first few drops came down. From song to song the rain got more heavy and from the middle of the show on it was raining cats and dogs. Until Florence I was always very lucky with the weather at Bruce open air shows, it never rained! But this was more than just rain! By the time the encores started we were already so wet and the water was two inches high in my shoes. But who cared? The show went on and on, Bruce in the sining and having fun in middle of the pouring rain. Me, wearing glasses, could hardly see anything. So what! Thousands of people left the stadium long before the end, not us. After Twist and Shout we all thought the show is over and we already headed to the exit but Bruce one more time came back and played \"Who'll stop the rain\" for us \"fucking die-hards\"! After 3,5 hours the show was over and it was my first show that I was happy it was over, not because it was bad or anything like that, but because I was freezing cold!<br/>\nWhat a show! What a night! I never thought he could top that show until I witnessed the epic show in Helsinki!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Badlands followed by No Surrender was the way to open a show like this and the crowd went crazy.<br/>\n3 songs from WB followed by MCOR and we were into the first of the wild card selections. Spirit is always great and Be True was a treat. Jack Of All Trades saw the whole of the Bernabeu in darkness apart from vast numbers of cellphone lights and cigarette lighters dotted round the pitch and 6 tiers of the stadium. Quite magical.<br/>\nBlistering versions of Youngstown, Murder Inc and She's The One saw the crowd back to full on before Bruce introduded Southside Johnny for an elongated, at times very amusing and warm duet on Talk To Me. Rumours before the show suggested that Spanish Eyes might get a world premiere and (staged or not), Bruce grabbed a sign from the crowd and played a great version.<br/>\nWorking On The Highway with a crowd like this couldn't fail and Shackled And Drawn was brilliant.<br/>\nWaiting On A Sunny Day brought the usual mad crowd response and in this crowd, it was loud. The guest \"singer\" was a very cute but dazed looking little boy who really only managed to repeat \"I'm waiteeeng, waiteeeng (sic) on a sunny day\" before Buce rescued him with a look that said \"how can it be so off key\" but in nice way of course.<br/>\nThe Apollo Medley went down well with Jake doing a seal impression, flopping across the stage at one point.<br/>\nThe River was then played, always fantastic, I only learned subsequently, that Bruce had dedicated it (in Spanish) to the girlfriend and family of a 20 year old boy who'd had tickets for the show but had sadly passed away not long before.<br/>\nBecause The Night and My Love Will Not Let You Down were absolutely red hot versions and the crowd's reactions added to the intensity.<br/>\nBy the time, The Rising, We Are Alive and Thunder Road (really great on this tour) were over, any encores were going to make this a long long show.<br/>\nI'm glad Bruce played Rocky Ground because some shows have skipped it. The double Born shot of USA followed by Run is and was incredible and the crowd were off the scale by then.<br/>\nHungry Heart and a terrific Seven Nights To Rock and of course Dancing In The Dark maintained the energy before Tenth Avenue Freeze Out and an emotional response to the Clarence, Danny tribute possibly finished the show.<br/>\nWith incredibly loud crowd chants and Bruce lying flat on his back onstage, it took two soakings for Bruce from Steve of the magic sponge to revive him to get up and launch into a brilliant version of the ever popular Twist and Shout.<br/>\nAs Bruce and the band took their final bows, I really thought we might get one more. Steve was up for it but when he looked at Bruce, it was obvious Bruce could do no more.<br/>\nSo a quick check on the watch and it's after 25 past one in the morning and the show has become the longest ever in Bruce's career at 3 hours 48.<br/>\nSuch an efficient stadium, we were all outside in minutes into the warm Madrid early morning. All smiles everywhere, we'd seen a very very special show.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Went to both Sunderland and Manchester with my daughter, travelling to Manchester straight after the end of the Sunderland concert to get an early start in the Manchester line. It rained on us solidly all day, miraculously clearing for the concert itself. The conditions were appalling, we resembled a group of Emporer Penguins huddled together against the wind and rain. The fans who organised the line did a tremendous job in what were very difficult circumstances, unfortunately the ordered nature of the line totally broke down when the stadium security staff refused to engage with the fans and Bruce's own security team. It became a free for all with all doors opening at the same time and the number system overridden by an ill judged decision that frankly placed the security staff and the fans at risk in the rush to get into the pit. I am ashamed this happened in the UK and this was one of my worst experiences after queuing for Bruce's concerts across Europe and the US.<br/>\nBruce and the band, in their own brilliant way, made up for all the trouble. My daughter and I were so fortunate in the end and got second row just left of the central podium. The pit was electric, I love hearing the Badlands theme reverberating through the crowd ahead of the band coming on stage, a sign that the crowd is in top form and ready for a great night ahead. This particular event was exceptional, did Bruce try to make it up to the fans for the pain we all went through earlier in the day?<br/>\nThe set list was the best I have experienced and may never be bettered. Some outstanding moments being: Prove It All Night with the 78 intro; Bruce solo at the piano for the Promise; and Save My Love. More than these though, it was brilliantly balanced, a fantastic combination of sheer joy and hard tough messaging reflecting these difficult times. I loved the change in pace between the hard rocking songs and the Wrecking Ball material with the quieter slower paced interludes of the E Street Shuffle, Spirit In The Night, My City of Ruins and the River.<br/>\nThe best ever concert in the UK? I am not sure about that, it was brilliant and up there with the best I have seen, but it was different. I so miss Danny and The Big Man. We are all growing older and there are different perspectives. It is lovely seeing the younger audience including my daughter in such rapture at these events, their emotion taking me back to the wide eyed awe that I experienced at my first River concert in 1981. The band has evolved, the backing singers and horns providing a fabulous addition to the line up. Jake is such a perfect stand-in for C and was note perfect throughout this concert, and Charlie has slotted in seamlessly. Above all, Bruce's back catalogue is now so extensive that he can generate these fabulous sets.<br/>\nThere were some memorable moments beyond that exceptional set list, the boy wearing a \"Believe The Hype\" T shirt singing on Waiting On A Sunny Day and his counting the band back in, Bruce literally trying to hold it all together assisting Curt Ramm with his trumpet's microphone after he flew head long onto the stage and Steve and Gary in fits of laughter. The icing on the cake, my daughter getting on stage to dance with Jake and give Bruce a huge hug, that stunned me, I had tears in my eyes and found it hard to keep composed. My thanks to those that captured this special moment on you tube, I did not have the presence of mind nor the right camera equipment.<br/>\nMy thanks to Bruce and all in the Band, what a spectacular performance! As always it was wonderful meeting new friends in the line and in the pit and a special thanks to Paul for the coloured pens!

Then the Rarity of take them as they come, so many great memories in my brothers car with my best mate and him singing that at the top of our lungs, he's living in Denmark now and it gain just brought a lump to my throat. I don't know how he does it, the odds are that he shouldn't be that great, but every time I see Bruce he just better and better!! This has truly been the best year, seeing Bruce in Manchester then Hyde Park. My girl broke up with me, and Hyde Park was the 7 month anniversary of us meeting, and it just wiped her out, Bruce just lifted me up, made me spit in the face of those badlands, and whilst shouting BRING ON YOUR WRECKING BALL at the top of my lungs he helped me get over it. He will forever be in my opinion the greatest performer/songwriter of all time! They may have cut the power, but they will never cut that feeling in the bottom of your gut that you get when shouting out TRAMPS LIKE US, BABY WE WERE BORN TO RUN!

Bruce was in fine form as usual, some nice surprises (for me anyway) in the set-list, first time hearing \"Take them\u2026.\" Well done to the geezer from Spain.

It followed two amazing Gothenburg Ullevi shows that for many of those who were there, said they were amongst their best ever. For those lucky enough (not me unfortunately) to be early into the Olympic Stadium in Helsinki, they were rewarded with the appearance of Bruce some 2 hours before the main show eventually started. A 35 minute 5 song acoustic reward for the many fans who travel to so many on a tour. Bruce always puts on a good show that offers true value for those attending but sometimes, you can see it in his face, hear it in his voice, he's up for a very special evening and Helsinki proved that. Coming on to the stage at just after 7.50\u00a0pm, Bruce said \"Oh man, this is our last stop in Europe, let's do it right, alright?\" before opening with \"Rocking All Over The World\". It seemed like a statement of intent and so it proved. \"Night\", \"Out In The Street\", \"Loose Ends\" and \"Prove It All Night 78 intro\" followed and already the show was an exceptional one. The 3 pack Wrecking Ball songs lead into \"My City Of Ruins\" where Bruce surely seemingly wanted to freeze time during his spoken interlude. \"Time keeps on ticking, ticking away and I'm gonna stand right here, where time can't get me, right in this spot. Don't you move either\". Wow, we all felt it! \"Does This Bus Stop\", \"Be True\", \"Jack Of All Trades\", Downbound Train\" and the always incredible \"Because The Night\" and this show just keeps going. Even \"Lonesome Day\" sounds fresher tonight and \"Darlington County\" always inspires the crowds. A terrific \"Light Of Day\" keeps it going and \"Shackled And Drawn\" has been great live on this tour. \"Waiting On A Sunny Day\" well, crowds love it, Bruce knows it! Next is \"Back In Your Arms\" and I think maybe the best I've ever seen Bruce perform a song. The emotion he imparted was breathtaking, he was in a different zone as he at one point turned his back on the audience and let his voice take us away. No great soul or r &amp; b singer of the golden years could have performed this song any better, just stunning! \"The Rising\", \"Badlands\", \"Land Of Hope And Dreams\" (oh how I love this song!) and \"We Are Alive\" and we're set for the encores. Already, it's a long show and Bruce says \"let's bring it home\" before launching into \"Born In The USA\" and then \"Born To Run\". The somewhat reserved but adoring Finnish crowd are now really rocking and a great \"Detroit Medley\", \"Glory Days\" and \"Dancing In The Dark\" keep up the pace. \"Tenth Avenue Freeze Out\" with the tributes follows and I then expected \"Twist And Shout\" but Bruce goes to the crowd and pulls a sign for \"I Don't Wanna Go Home\". He and Steve perform it together, just superb! Bruce says \"one more\" and it's \"Higher and Higher\", this is an incredible finish. Jon Landau gets an invite and guitar to join the band on stage and we've now beaten the previous longest show (Madrid 2012). Bruce doesn't want to go home though and an 11 minute \"Twist And Shout\" with an interlude to celebrate breaking the 4 hour barrier brings this marathon to an end.<br/>\nThis Wrecking Ball tour has been fantastic and of the shows I saw, Madrid had the crazy crowd and a very long show, Vienna had some great songs but Helsinki was very very special and \"epic\"!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

We'd hop in his car and drive 20 minutes from my hometown into the Fens. He'd usually find one of his \"secret\" spots to park without having to pay and my Dad would take my little hand in his and walk to the park. Later, when I got a little older we'd sometimes jog through those backstreets so we wouldn't miss anything important. My father had a season pass for most of my youth, so we went to quite a few games, typically finding seats somewhere in the grandstand along the first base line, or if it was really crowded we'd stand behind the last row of seats and watch from there. I loved everything about baseball and going to games at Fenway and God only knows how many games I went to, but there were many.<br/>\nMy father was my best friend and my hero and I thought he'd always be around, but life is never quite so easy or kind and my Dad died from lymphoma in 1989. He was only 63 and I still can't forgive the world for cheating him out of a long life. I knew the morning that he died that my world would never again be so sweet and full of joy. I had a hard time at first accepting his departure from this world and I hated going to Fenway without him.<br/>\nBut we all grow up and lose the people we truly love and after a long time, the pain of missing my father began to fade. Lately, thanks mostly to another hero of mine, I've been learning to believe that the people we love never really leave us. Like Bruce Springsteen says so often, we must learn to accept the hard lessons that life teaches us and find joy in the present and the wonders of living \"right now.\"<br/>\nWhen I listened to Bruce this week inside Fenway Park talk about living with ghosts, I knew he could have been talking about the people he has lost - his father, Terry McGovern, Danny, Clarence, heck even the late great Johnny Pesky, but when Bruce was talking about ghosts and singing songs like \"We Are Alive,\" I was mostly thinking about my Dad.<br/>\nAnd last night during one of the most incredible evenings of my life, Bruce called out during his jaw-dropping rendition of \"Frankie,\" for people to light thousands of tiny lights all over the stands and on the field to create the look of fireflies on a summer's night\u2026and I swear to you that I felt the presence of my father, who I've missed so much over the years and whose absence has made me cry, cry, cry\u2026but he was back with me again, holding my hand and cheering his heart out standing there next to me like a spirit in the night!<br/>\nAnd a bit later, with the rain pouring down, and with Bruce Springsteen welcoming the rain again and again to soak his face and baptize him in the spotlight, with a grin from ear to ear, I let it all rain down on me too. And the water from the heavens above Fenway Park mixed with my tears; tears of happiness and tears of joy, as I understood and believed that my father had never really left me alone in this hard and lonely world.<br/>\nSo once again I give thanks to Bruce Springsteen for helping me make sense of this life and for reminding me that I can accept my father and so many other ghosts back into my life and walk with my Pop side by side and talk to him when I need to hear his voice. What a tremendous gift from a man who has spent most of his life trying to help all of us through our lonesome days; who has brought all of us so much happiness; who has always been the older brother that I never had; and who will always be my hero.<br/>\nThere's no way to repay these gifts, other than to give him accolades, constant respect and simply remember to always be grateful. I try to do that by holding my hand up when Bruce offers his, by cheering with every muscle in my body and by believing\u2026always believing\u2026believing\u2026believing that dreams will not be thwarted and that faith will be rewarded.<br/>\nThank you Bruce Springsteen for two unforgettable nights at Fenway Park\u2026for filling my eyes with tears and fireflies and for once again filling my heart with hope and a reason to believe.<br/>\nIt's true. There's a new day coming. I will always remain a believer. It's only our bodies that betray us. Our souls and spirits never, ever die.<br/>\nThey are alive.<br/>\n\"So Dad, you wanna go watch a ball game tonight?\"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Suzy Peabody</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">I still haven't recovered from this show.

I tried to play prove it, while driving, and thought \"it's probably not a good idea to be driving and listening to this song at the same time\". Frankie, a song I didn't know before the show, is the seminal concert experience in my life. I can't bring myself to watch a video, yet, because in my head it's so unbelievably perfect that I don't think the reality of that moment could match it. The cell phones, fireflies, just so crazy perfect. How does he lead us to such beautiful places as a field in 1978? I knew with each song, that I was in a moment that I'd never want to leave. I don't think there will ever be another show like this for me. I never wanted to go to sleep that night, never wanted the night to end.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I think it may actually be the highlight of my life so far\u2026\u2026 It took 36 hours just to get from Wellington NZ to Moncton -no one at WGTN airport had ever even heard of Moncton before!! But it was worth every moment !!! The night itself was indeed perfect \u2014 alas it wizzed past in a blur way too quickly.<br/>\nIt was surreal finally seeing Bruce and the band - i had to keep pinching my friend to make sure i wasn't dreaming !! The weather was beautiful coming from a southern hemisphere winter, the moon was huge. Bruce was amazing, he did everything he was supposed to, it was great to hear him talk and also see him play piano. Also i gained a real appreciation of Sunny day seeing how much enjoyment Bruce gets from performing it. At the beginning i thought i was having a heart attack then i realised it was Garry's bass coming up through the ground straight to my heart!!! Nils' solo in Because the night was every bit as wonderful as i knew he would be. Shacked &amp; drawn was a completely unexspected highlight - Cindy was great !! as was the audience participation orchestrated by Bruce at the beginning with the lighting effects. I wish there was really good u tube footage available - i sourced an audio boot but it is not soundboard and has a lot of crowd chatter. That was one thing i didn't like - too many people not paying enough attention to Bruce (-and also it wasn't a smoke free venue). Jack of all trades brought tears to my eyes, lucky i had been to the bathroom before the show and i got to enjoy every moment!!! As it was really important to me to pay my respects to C and also Danny it was most generous of Bruce to allow us to do that through 10th av freeze out -my arms ached from clapping so much !! I was astonished to hear how great Charlie was (-but then Bruce only has the best), Soozie was just beautiful. The facilities at the ground were very good but transport to and from the venue was abismil and poorly advertised -i was only in town for 3 days and i don't speak French. We walked for two hours to find a taxi afterwards.<br/>\nIt is a pity that this show never got the rave revue it deserves - you can't tell what a night was like just from reading a set list I was disapointed in the ho-hum coverage from within the Springsteen community eg. the review ran in Backstreets. If anyone has pictures form this show i would love to see them (<span class=\"wiki-email\">zn.oc.oohay|sesorfohctac#zn.oc.oohay|sesorfohctac</span>)</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Just grabs and takes you down to that Greasy Lake Bruce brought us to earlier so we can be baptized in a night of rock 'n' roll! We Are Alive is another highlight.

Bruce's delivery of Adam, Prove it, Streets of Fire and Something in the Night was intense, focused, powerful and raw. The new songs keep sounding better, especially Death to My Hometown, Shackled and We Are Alive. Spirit was rock 'n' roll preacher Bruce at his best. Had to be the best version I've ever seen him do. It's amazing how the performances keep changing, the bar keeps getting raised, Bruce and band constantly taking it to a new level, making it sound vital, fresh, alive! Hats off to all of you. Saint in the City was smoking. Play that every night and the fans will go wild. The show lost a little steam as it continued. Frankie was beautifully done, as was one of the most emotional versions of The River. If he had placed those 2 back to back, then dropped Lonesome Day and perhaps played Because the Night or Backstreets, the momentum would have continued into the encores. Wasn't sure I wanted to hear Jungleland without the Big Man's sax, but Jake definitely made C proud. Powerful version that echoed the theme of the show's start as Bruce's dark poetic side highlighted this night's show thru out.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

I look forward to hearing them just as much as I do his killer classic songs.<br/>\nMy City of Ruins, beautiful, heartfelt, a song so connected to life itself that I can't imagine anyone not relating to and appreciating it. It's one of Bruce's best songs easily. Spirit and E Street Shuffle were terrific, full of energy. Although they aren't terrible songs, Darlington, Working on the Highway and Easy Money dropped the momentum level for me. But then a magnificent Racing in the Streets more than made up for it.

An early highlight came with a blistering Lost in the Flood, a song that is so relevant today. A dark epic that could easily sit beside Dylan's Desolation Row. But the show wasn't all dark poetry, the party kicked in with a rousing Does this Bus Stop, Jol\u00e9 Blon, This Little Girl, a killer Small Things and an hilarious Talk to Me, with Bruce mugging it up. One of the best mid-sets I've ever seen him do. A tight Mary's Place was an unexpected treat, one of my favorite songs from the Rising collection. The ever romantic Incident, beautifully rendered, raised the show to a 10+. It also didn't hurt that he played it right into a rousing Rosie!<br/>\nGreat to hear Ramrod and American Land again, as they added some muscle to the encores.

I'm glad the show went on that night because Bruce and band gave his patient and loyal fans a truly kickass night of rock 'n' roll. 7 songs before even touching the new material.<br/>\nA rousing Out in the Streets, Ties that Bind, Cynthia, Badlands, Who'll Stop the Rain, a killer Cover Me and powerful Downbound Train set the bar high for the night's expectations. And Bruce and band delivered with all cylinders firing constantly. The new material rocked hard and Bruce kept it going with a pumped up Saint in the City. Great to see Gary Bonds back for Joel Blon and This Little Girl. Bruce and Bonds were obviously having fun reprising the 2 songs from the previous night, which added to the party atmosphere. The horns and band really jammed on a terrific Pay Me My Money Down. Then came a soulful version of Midnight Hour \u2014 AMAZING! A really heartfelt and powerful Into the Fire was a highlight of the night. Wish Bruce would rotate this one with The Rising and Mary's Place so as to save the Rising from being so overplayed. Into the Fire is just as powerful, equally as good for honoring the lost and fallen of that day.Because the Night and She's the One smoked, taking the show to another level and burning away any worries that Bruce was going to slow the show down and bring it to encore time. Meeting and a Big Man worthy Jungleland had the enthusiastic crowd cheering long and loud.<br/>\nIf Bruce was feeling any ghosts that evening, it was apparent with his song selections: Because the Night, She's the One, Jungleland and starting the encores with Thunder Road\u2014excellent choices that mirrored the theme of ghosts and their constant inspiration. If Bruce was feeling the Big Man's spirit on what became his 63rd birthday celebration at the concert, he let the songs speak for him, and speak for him, to us, they did.<br/>\nRight then the show could have ended and I would have left more than satisfied. But the show continued with a powerful Rocky Ground, a high energy Born to Run, Glory Days and 7 Nights to Rock (love that song!). And 10th Ave \u2014 simply great as always, the perfect way to honor the Big Man and his contributions to so many of Bruce's best songs.<br/>\nBy 2am, the party was over, but the spirit lingered for days afterwards. Thanks Bruce and band for delivering a classic performance; for putting out a terrific new cd that is actually full of songs that have relevance to our lives, that actually have something to say, that are worth listening to and raising our voices along with. Thanks for adding your own voice to our concerns and frustrations. And especially thanks for the celebratory and salvational nights of real rock 'n' roll.

The horn section is a terrific addition to the E Street sound - giving Born To Run a real shot in the arm. Jake Clemons was a big hit and a worthy replacement for the Big Man. Bruce sent the crowd wild with his finale of Rosalita and 10th Ave Freezout. Although a lot of people aren't familiar with the songs off Wrecking Ball - they still went down well - particularly Shackled &amp; Drawn and Death To My Hometown. The night's rarity was Red Headed Woman - Bruce couldn't resist when he saw two separate requests for the song in the audience - he started solo before the band worked out how to accompany him.

So last night when he said we can go on taking requests or we can do the whole of darkness on the edge of town I could of cried with joy but I'm English so I didn't! As he launched into badlands and knowing that something in the night streets of fire and RACING IN THE STREET and all of them were to come is something ill never forget. Thank you Bruce and e street!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Nigel</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">An intense, passionate performance! After five days it is finally sinking in and I'm semi-rational again. This was up there with some of the best shows I have seen, nudging into the top five of the 25 I have been fortunate enough to experience over the years, alongside the second night of the Wembley Arena run on the River Tour in 1981 (my first), the two MSG New York City shows at the end of 2009 for the WIESS and River albums and Manchester last year where my daughter got on stage in her blue boots, bless her.<br/>\nI always get a lot of fun out of meeting fellow fans and being part of the build up to the show. I read that the Brits and overseas fans were separated in the queues going into the stadium, I did not realise that on the day, but I guess it must have been true. Anyhow, we were all back together once inside and I was amongst a great group of people in the pit from a variety of European countries. The only disappointment in the queuing being the intense tropical downpour that drenched us late afternoon, memories of Manchester flooded back.<br/>\nIt was clear from early on that something special was up. I don't want to repeat what I have read in all the fabulous five star reviews and other fan comments, I just feel the need to capture some of the special moments I experienced from my perspective, six rows back from the central podium.<br/>\nBruce was buzzing with energy, his voice was in great shape and the band were in an excellent and playful mood, no doubt having benefited from the ten day rest. The mix of songs in that first phase was tremendous. I love Land of Hope and Dreams (but as others have said it didn't seem to fit so well in the first slot), but that combined with Jackson Cage, Save My Love and Rosalita, you got the sense this was far from being a routine Wrecking Ball show. Then Lost in the Flood! I have waited three decades to hear that song live and it was done brilliantly, Bruce full of passion and fiery intensity, certainly the highlight from the first third of the show.<br/>\nThe full Darkness on the Edge of Town was very special, I had been secretly hoping to hear this album in full but did not dare to imagine that would happen, I feel so lucky to have experienced this. A sensational performance, handled majestically and with dignity by the band. A dark set of songs, it surprised me that Bruce put this on for Wembley, but it was phenomenal. And I got to hear another song that has eluded me for many years, Streets of Fire was a highlight of many great moments from this stretch of the show.<br/>\nThe sound has received a lot of criticism, I am sure that the half roof on Wembley Stadium did not help in this respect. I was very lucky to be dead centre and right at the front so did not notice the reverb except in the quieter moments when the effect seemed to add to the atmosphere, particularly the middle section of Something in The Night with the slow drum beat echoing around the stands and finally the emotional Thunder Road resonating out into the night.<br/>\nAt these concerts, alongside the memories of all the wonderful music and the style of performance, it is often the little moments that stick most in the mind. So I won't forget seeing Max watching Bruce like a hawk as his feet tapped out the slow beat in that mid section of Something In The Night. This together with Nils and Steve dashing for guitar changes ahead of Rosalita demonstrated the fluidity in choice and performance of songs during this fabulous concert. Steve was in a fun, playful mood. There was a great moment during Rosalita when he was on the central podium with Bruce and Jake and when Bruce was not looking he strolled to the front with his arms out wide as if to say \"here I am, my people\" then, with a furtive look over the shoulder, he slunk back again behind his boss. During Pay Me My Money Down when Bruce, Charlie and Jake were on the central podium, as the music stops midway through and Bruce gets the small group around me to pick up the rhythm and bring the band back in, at that moment it felt as if we were in a little club, the 71000 people around and behind us might as well have not been there.<br/>\nThen Thunder Road to finish, beautiful and very moving, like many I had tears in my eyes and a lump in the throat. That will stay with me forever.<br/>\nSo I'm now ready for the next performance on this leg of the tour. After that experience, I'm not sure that I can hope to see anything better, but as in all things with Bruce, I know it will be passionate, unexpected and a huge pleasure. Roll on HRC, Born to Run anyone?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Woody</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">It's two days after the show\u2026.. i have lost my voice, my legs &amp; feet ache, im feeling exactly the same way as i do after every other boss show i have attended over the years but boy i am not complaning!!

Of course thats just my opion but with that slight feeling of anti-climax(no more bruce shows syndrome) still for some reason in my mind I was determined that I must catch another show before the end of this tour &amp; Cardiff looked to be a safe bet. I will not bore everyone about the show\u2026people that were there will have their own views, memories etc, but for me personally, to finally hear \"Roulette\"(one of my top 5 Bruce songs) for the first time live was worth the trip alone!\u2026then throw in the one &amp; only performance (so far)of \"TV Movie\" then we get \"Cynthia\" \u2026 \"Im a Rocker\"\u2026 \"Summertime Blues\"\u2026 \"We gotta get out of this Place\"\u2026 \"Janey Dont you Lose Heart\"\u2026!! all these before mentioned songs were \"first timers live\" for me so you can understand why i am still beaming thinking about the show even now\u2026..then throw in old chestnuts like \"Boom Boom\" \"Ramrod\" \"Spirit in the Night\"\u2026..i could go on but i wont. Just wanted to say as this was definately my last gig this tour, thanks to all the fans who really made the shows that I attended(Wembley, Coventry, Olympic Park, Cardiff)even more memorable.

The last time I was at his concert was in Slane Castle all those years ago and I hobbled in on cruthes for miles to see him. As I thought it would be the end of his world tour in Kilkenny I decided back in February to draw a painting to commemorate Bruce and Kilkenny together. I tried to figure out where he would stay and Lyrath or Mount Juliet seemed to be the place. So with that I drew several more paintings of Irish musicians and went to Lyrath. One of the managers Terry was really nice and allowed me to hang my paintings there during the Bruce week-end and I was really hoping he would see it and sign the hurl on the painting and then I was going to give it to him as a memory of his life on the road, as a line in his song goes(looking for the map that brings me home)it's a pity he didn't get to see it I think he would have liked it. Any idea how one could send it to him? Not an easy task I know as I tried everything under creation to see him, I could write a book on it alone. Can't even find a web site to post it up on. Now as for the concert it was as good as it was back all those years ago. I danced the whole evening with all my family and friends even as our great historical hurlers were beaten on the day,they too were to be seen 'dancing' on the pitch later that evening and well deserved. A great evening to remember for all his fans.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Nice tribute to the late Lou Reed with \"Sweet Jane\".<br/>\nClose to midnight Bruce tour thru a bunch of tunes with the Houserockers: \"Adam Raised the Cain\", \"Darkness\", \"Atlantic City\" and \"Because the Night\" and a bluesy, extended jam on \"Never Be Enough Time\".<br/>\nTwo surprises came with a beautiful rendition of \"Hearts of Stone\" and rocking \"Frankie Fell In Love\", which definitely has a \"Two Hearts\" and \"Held Up Without a Gun\" feel to it \u2014 loved it.<br/>\nThe evening closed with the entire audience singing all of \"Thunder Road\", which was an amazing way to cap off terrific night of music from everyone.<br/>\nLooking forward to the upcoming tour.\"</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Started off with a song from the local Gibb boys complete with funky wah-wah guitar from Morello (or maybe it was Nils). Then tore into the killer sequence of Saint/82nd St/Growin'/Spirit. Everyone having fun and loose, in a great mood after a day at the beach. After a few crowd songs Bruce conducts an audience poll as to whether we will go with more signs or stick to the plan, which is a start-to-finish Wild, Innocent, E Street Shuffle. Huge crowd response ensures it is the latter. I am in raptures, with Kitty on top of my hope-they-play list (along with Thundercrack, which was a long shot I guess). I'm wondering how this can get any better as the last moments of NYC Serenade are fading away (He's singing \u2026singing \u2026.) The 8 ladies in long black dresses forming the string section deserve a mention, looking beautiful and soaring over the vocals.<br/>\nFrom this high point (for me) it is back to more fun and audience participation. Steve (who was so missed on the 2013 Aussie tour) and Bruce doing slapstick and pulling faces on Darlington and Glory Days. It was 11pm (the scheduled finish time) before BTR kicked in, with the house lights and PA volume on full bikkie. But the night was far from over. A yell and a wave to the Prof and we were into Bobby Jean. With everyone exhausted, 3 more full on band songs followed, until finally at 11.45, Bruce played a simple finale, Thunder Road on acoustic.<br/>\nOverall, my 5th BS&amp;tESB over 29 years was a wonderful experience. AND Bruce says he will be BACK AGAIN<br/>\nOther random notes:<br/>\nAgain the trend from this tour of doing songs by local bands continued. Actually, it started last year in Brisbane on the first show of the tour with the first ever \"Just Like Fire Would\".<br/>\nTom Joad has turned into a mini guitar epic of its own since Tom Morello was roped in last year (Miami Steve was in Norway doing Lillehammer). Unfortunately, we missed out on Nils' feature spot on \"Youngstown\".<br/>\nIt seemed to really be a 50:50 proposition that Bruce would stick to the Wild/Innocent plan. He seemed to be having too much fun with crowd songs and realised the show was going to be VERY long if he stuck to plan. Perhaps the string section waiting in the wings was the clincher. How sad it would have been for them to miss out. Never mind, the end result was stunning.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Wouldn't mind if they pulled that out more often. \"Save the Last Dance\" was a beautiful moment.

Bruce was on fire from the moment he stepped on stage and remained so through out the entire show. The main set alone blazed with simply some great rock 'n' roll.<br/>\nThe show started with a rousing \"Roll of the Dice\" and \"Leap of Faith\" combo. \"Jump\" was also very good. An unusual request for \"Santa Claus\" actually had the entire place singing along. \"Seven Angels\" definitely needs to be played more. \"Frankie\" was also a great choice that night. Although \"Darkness on the Edge of Town\" is not an epic song, Bruce played it as if it were and it was intense! \"You Can Look\" was fun to hear, as Bruce and Stevie shared the mike with this one, as well as on, \"Frankie Fell in Love.\"<br/>\nThen came an extended set of hard-hitting rock. One of the best \"Adam Raised the Cain\" versions I've seen. Bruce burned the solos and the band kicked some real muscle into it. Following \"Adam\" came \"High Hopes\", \"Youngstown\", \"Murder Incorporated\", an extended, powerful, \"Johnny 99\", \"Cadillac Ranch\" and \"I'm a Rocker!\" The Springsteen/Morello version of \"Ghost of Tom Joad\" is simply a highlight of any of the shows. Wondering where Bruce was going to take the show after opening the encores with \"Born to Run\" and \"Ramrod\", an extremely emotional and spiritual version of \"Jungleland\" and \"Dream Baby Dream\" closed out one of the best shows I've seen Bruce and band play. He managed to balance a night of hard-rocking songs with a very emotional end to the show, the night and the tour. What makes Bruce unique as a performer is that, he goes on instinct, and after delivering an intense, nonstop rock show, he gave us what many rock shows fail to deliver, a moment of personal intimacy that truly connects and resonates with his audience. It's exactly what great music should be and there's no greater performer or band to deliver such a promise. And they do so, night after night, tour after tour. Amen to that!<br/>\nThanks once again for some amazing shows, even if this leg of the tour was a short one.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Bruce and the band brought it from the start. Playing in front of a packed house, Meet Me in the City kicked off the show and was well received by the crowd who largely seemed to be familiar with the new outtake. The River album performance was everything I hoped it to be. The band rocked hard on Cadillac Ranch, You Can Look, and Ramrod. Crush on You and I'm a Rocker were also extremely fun and played well live. Drive All Night and Fade Away were powerful, and to my surprise Bruce brought out the 12 string guitar for The Price You Pay. After The River album finished, the second set electrified the crowd. A strong rendition of Atlantic City kicked off the post-River set. Nils performed a fantastic solo on Prove it All Night, and he even broke out a spin as he solo'd. Following that, My Love Will Not Let You Down had its tour premiere. I would love to hear that one in the set more often. When the opening notes of Jungleland rang out, I instinctively thought \"wow, this is special.\" A flawless Jungleland floored the crowd. Rosie and Dancing in the Dark were fun as always, and even though they're being played every night, they're still a highlight of the show. Shout closed the show as anticipated, and everyone went home dancing. It was a wonderful, fun night in Philly.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

This was my 20th time seeing him and I was quite ecstatic with this performance. I went with my Brother in Law Ron who is a Dead Head but definitely an aficionado of all music. I think he was particularly pleased with the large share of songs from 1973!!!!!!<br/>\nIn terms of a review - simply the best show I have ever seen. I have seen some great, great American shows - 7/18/99, 7/1/00, 10/4/02, 9/7/03, 9/2/12 and 10/26/12 to name a few of the ones I have seen. I had seen him earlier this year in Baltimore (which was great but the feeling I left was that I have seen this show several times - even though I love side 4 of the River).<br/>\nWhat worked tonight - simply everything from the Opening, to Spirit (which was amazing) to Lost in the Flood to the Incident/Rosie combo. My favorite moment was the BITUSA segment of the show and the American Skin / Promised Land part. Just nailed Promised Land which is every bit as good as Badlands! Other special notable parts to the show was Trapped and Secret Garden.<br/>\nFor someone to have seen the performer 20 times -and to get songs that I have not seen like Secret Garden or Does the Bus Stop- it still amazes me. The other thing that amazed me is that the show was totally different than the show that I had seen 4 months earlier.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Lasted 90 minutes. The moderator, David Remnick, from the New Yorker was great. He had done his homework, it's obvious he's a fan and really engaged Bruce who was talkative and told a lot of great stories.<br/>\nBruce read a couple times directly from the book.<br/>\nPatti Scialfa, Jon Landau, Patti Smith, Elliott Murphy and Charlie Rose were among the VIPs in the audience</p>\n<p><em>This is very long and basically from a bunch of notes I scribbled down.</em></p>\n<p>The evening started very close to 7 p.m. with Remnick coming out for about a .five-minute intro, talking about how in 1973 he went to Madison Square Garden to see the band Chicago, he sat up in the blue seats, but what he remembered most about that night was the opening act, Bruce Springsteen.<br/>\nThen he brought Bruce out, saying how Bruce has the No. 1 book on the New York Times bestsellers list, and Bruce said \"with a bullet!\"</p>\n<p>Remnick asked Bruce if he had read books by other musicians and did that influence him here and Bruce said \"I read Bob's (Dylan) book, I read Keith Richards' book, and I did it the way I knew how.\"<br/>\nRemnick then asked \"why now?\" and Bruce replied, \"I wanted to do it before I forget everything!\"<br/>\nRemnick asked Bruce if he relied on other people for some recollections and he said \"I called a few friends. I called George Theiss my friend who was in The Castiles to ask him about some things from back then. I wanted to get dates and the chronology right.\"<br/>\nFunny moment next when Dave Remnick asked him \"were there things you couldn't or wouldn't write about?\" and Bruce said \"I don't want to talk about that!\"<br/>\nHe then asked Bruce to read a passage from the book, Page 29 which was about his father. Bruce had to put on his reading glasses and the crowd cheered.<br/>\n\"I only use them in bed,\" Bruce said.<br/>\nBruce said the book was more than 50 years of experiences, two psychiatrists including one who died on me already.<br/>\nThe conversation turned to Bruce's parents leaving New Jersey when he was 17 and he talked about how his sister Ginny was pregnant and getting married to a bullrider. Bruce said \"we do have bullriders in New Jersey. There's Cowtown in South Jersey. which is a big rodeo.\"<br/>\nBruce talked about his mother \"When I was 13 she was just in her mid 30s and she always was listening to the radio. She was excited by Elvis, the Beatles. She was always playing the Top 40 radio in the house.\"<br/>\nBruce then was asked about the story early on in the book where he wrote about subbing for Mick Jagger one night.<br/>\n\"The Rolling Stones are playing Convention Hall in Asbury Park and Mick gets sick. A 15-year-old pimply kid looks up to Keith Richards who tells me to come on up!\"<br/>\nNext they played a short clip of \"Baby I\" by The Castiles and the crowd cheered as Bruce laughed. He talked about he was 16 when they recorded that in a little studio in Bricktown, NJ. \"We were a pretty intense little group.\"<br/>\nHe aid the single never made it to wax, \"we had it on acetate.<br/>\n\"We had a good time, that meant a lot to us.\"<br/>\nRemnick then asked Bruce about why Asbury Park was a popular place for musicians.<br/>\n\"It was the Jersey Shore's Fort Lauderdale. Bands came from all over to play there. There were a lot of bands playing top 40.\"<br/>\nNext Bruce talked about the Upstage Club in Asbury Park.<br/>\n\"It was a natural gather place for musicians. The Upstage was open from 8 to 5. It sold no booze so even younger people could hang out there. Bars back then were open until 3 a.m. so you had a lot of musicians who came in to jam after 3 a.m. There was a lot of jamming there. You signed your name on a list and you had a half hour to an hour to play.\"<br/>\nBruce also talked about playing the Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital in New Jersey \"there was a guy introducing us who kept going on and on\" until the attendants had to pull him off the stage. He also mentioned going to the Osprey in Manasquan and listening to the bands outside since he was too young to go inside.<br/>\nBruce talked about living above a beauty parlor (it was on the second floor) on Cookman Avenue in Asbury Park and that's where most of the songs from \"Greetings from Asbury Park\" came from.<br/>\nRemnick asked him about his audition for Columbia Records with John Hammond and Bruce told the story which is pretty much detailed in the book, how he had to borrow a guitar from one of his Castiles bandmates and it \"was a wild, wild day.\"<br/>\nBruce said how Mike Appel talked himself into getting into see John Hammond and that's was \"the great thing he (Mike) ever did.<br/>\n\"Mike told John Hammond I was the next biggest thing since Shakespeare and Bozo the Clown,\" Bruce said.<br/>\nMuch of the rest of the story is all in the book so I don't want to give too much away if you haven't read it yet with Bruce talking about how he felt before the audiition etc.<br/>\nBut it was great at the end when John Hammond said to him \":You got to be on Columbia Records.\"<br/>\nBruce then said: \"If things didn't work out I would have gone back to Asbury Park, put another band together and take another swing at it.\"<br/>\nThe discussion then turned to how his Dad inspired his much and his stage show.<br/>\n\"I put my Dad's work clothes on every day during the Born in the U.S.A. tour. I wanted to sing to him in some way.<br/>\nThey talked about the final 10 shows in the United States recently and how Patti suggested that he play of lot of songs from the early stuff.<br/>\nThere was a discussion about Clarence Clemons. \"Clarence was like a dream. I just wanted to hear that sound,\" Bruce said.<br/>\nHe then talked about the saxophone solo on \"Jungleland\" and it \"took a long, long time. It started out as a guitar solo and then turned into the saxophone.\"<br/>\nThey then played a short clip of \"Born to Run\" and the discussion turned in that direction about the recording of the song and Jimmy Iovine being the engineer. How Bruce liked how the song from \"Born to Run\" came out but he had problems with the whole album and did toss it into a swimming pool. How he and Jimmy Iovine finally listend to the album in a stereo store in Richmond, Va. because no one had a record player, so they asked if they could listen to it in the store.<br/>\nBruce was asked about his shows and he said \"You have to know why do people come to your shows. You want to know what it feels to really alive,\" as the audience applauded. He mentioned how a three-minute record can really inspired you and that \"I get paid to be as present as I can be on every night I'm out there.\"<br/>\nBruce mentioned how the Born in the U.S.A tour was filled with a lot of stress and talked about throwing a guitar near Jon Landau one night.<br/>\nRemnick said his wife wanted to know the answer to this question: \"What is your workout routine because this is ridiculous (how Bruce plays four-hour shows)?\" Bruce said \"It's all mental. Afterward (a four-hour show) I feel clear and can sleep and I'm too tired to be depressed.<br/>\n\"I have one opportunity to speak to these people and I may never see you again or they may never see me again.\"<br/>\nThe conversation turned to politics and Remnick asked Bruce his though on Donald Trump.<br/>\n\"I thought he was funny as a rich New York business man but it's not funny as a presidential candidate. I predict he will not win but he as done a lot of damage and I'm afraid of his lasting affect will have on history.\" and some of the other things he has said recently in interviews about the genie being out of the bottle.<br/>\nRemnick asked him if Bruce was disappointed in Obama and Bruce said \"I'm still a fan. I would have liked some things done better.\"<br/>\nBruce then talked about how his kids couldn't figure out \"why people (before selfies) were always asking him to scribble his name on pieces of paper?\"<br/>\n\"You know how you're interested in Barney? Well some people are interested in me that way.\"<br/>\nHe also said that his oldest son, Evan, came home one day from school and asked him \"What is a Tenth Avenue Freeze-out?\" That some kids in school had heard about it from there parents. Bruce said he then pulled out his acoustic guitar and played it for him.<br/>\nRemnick asked Bruce about how long can he keep going and he said \"there's no end in sight. I will have no trouble sitting in my chair just playing my acoustic guitar.\"<br/>\nThe evening ended with Bruce reading another passage from the book which has been posted on several videos.<br/>\nOverall a very rewarding evening. I do hope the audio is made available from this as it was a special night for Bruce and his fans and should be shared for all to hear.<br/>\nSome notes:<br/>\nIt was all general admission and the place was filled up. But you could have gotten there after the doors opened (around 6:05\u00a0pm..) and still had a great seat, pretty much anywhere was a great spot.<br/>\nThey handed you an autographed copy of the book as you walked in.<br/>\nPatti Scialfa came in just as the lights went down and sat in the second row on the aisle on the right side facing the stage.She was clapping along with everyone else and also taking pictures on her phone.<br/>\nShe was mentioned several times by Bruce and one time as people clapped he said \"Yeah, let's hear it for Patti!\"</p>\n<p><em>If you made it this far, thank you for reading.\ufeff</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Although we didn't learn much new, it was entertaining and a thrill to be there..<br/>\nSpotted In the audience were Malia Obama, Patti Scialfa, Rita Wilson, Jon Landau and Gayle King. Also many of the fans from across the country, Canada and Europe packed the theater.<br/>\nIt lasted about an hour, with Hanks focusing mostly on Bruce's early bands and early work before he realized time was getting short and he rushed it a bit at the end.<br/>\nWarning, this is very long, but does cover most of the conversation.</p>\n<p>Hanks began the conversation by talking about Jonathan Demme, the director of \"Philadelphia\" who passed away earlier this week.<br/>\n\"I think the strongest union of our two names is probably 'Philadelphia,' \" Hanks said. \"God bless Jonathan Demme. We just lost him.\"<br/>\n\"He was such an inspirational guy,\" Bruce said. \"No Jonathan Demme, no 'Philadelphia,' no 'Streets of Philadelphia' .\"<br/>\nBruce explained his quick process of writing the song which Demme asked him to write after Neil Young sent him \"Philadelphia,\" which closes the movie.<br/>\nDemme wanted \"more of a rock song for the beginning, so I said I'd give it a shot,\" Bruce said. \"I tried for a day or so to come up with something, and I didn't come up with anything. I had some lyrics. Eventually, I just came up with that tiny little beat and the track, and I figured it wasn't what he wanted but I sent it to him anyway. He sent me that opening piece of film where the camera moves slowly through Philly, and I said, 'What do you think?' And he says, 'Great.' And that was it. It took about two days.\"<br/>\n\"Well, I have to tell you,\" Hanks said, \"if you ever want to have a great moment in a motion picture, walk out a door and make sure they just put up a Bruce Springsteen song.\"<br/>\nFrom there, Hanks took his notes from Bruce's autobiography \"Born to Run\" and a few times he would start the lyrics to a song and have the audience finish them. \"I'm going to have to start doing that,\" Bruce said.<br/>\nTom asked Bruce \"Did Jersey make Springsteen or did Springsteen make New Jersey? You write about New Jersey as a place you have to get out of and the place you must return to. Would you have formed the E Street Band if you had grown up in Texas?\"<br/>\nBruce answered that by talking about a trip he took to San Francisco in 1970. \"We played a little club, a place called the Matrix. I'm in the bathroom, I'm pissing next to this guy and he says 'you guys are pretty good. Where are you from?'<br/>\n\"I said New Jersey. He said, 'what's that?' He didn't say \"where's that.\"<br/>\n\"My first record I wasn't a New York artist and I was from New Jersey, that's why I named it \"Greetings from Asbury Park.\"<br/>\nTom then said: \"One of the greatest addresses I've have ever heard and said something made up and Bruce replied: \"39\u00a01/2 Institute Street.\" (his second childhood home in Freehold).<br/>\n\"We need to put blue markers there saying Bruce Springsteen lived here,\" said Hanks. He then had Bruce talk about his early years.<br/>\n\" My grandfather was an electrician. We would go out to trash and go through every trash can in Freehold, New Jersey,\" he said to cheers from the audience. Bruce then said: \"Is that for trash or for Freehold, N.J.?\"<br/>\nBruce continued: \"television was just taking hold. The centerpiece of the living room was the big radio cabinet.\"<br/>\nTom: \"You stayed up til 3\u00a0o'clock in the morning.\"<br/>\nBruce: \"Yes, I did. it was no coincidence that later on I took a job where I stayed up til 3 a.m. When I was very young I would sleep to three in the afternoon and get up at three in the morning because I could.<br/>\nWhen I got in school, I hated school because I had to get up at 8 a.m. I hated every minute of it until I got out.\"<br/>\nTom said \"You learned more from a three-minute record than we ever learned in school\" to laughs.<br/>\nBruce said how he grew up near the Catholic church and he saw funerals, weddings. He went to church twice a week, \"the nuns were our neighbors. Faith was very big. We were an Italian, Irish family.<br/>\n\"It was a factory town.\"<br/>\nTom asked: \"If you hadn't been dazzled by the music coming out of the radio, where would you have gotten your first job?<br/>\n\"The only honest work I've ever done in my entire life, at 14-15 years old, I was a lawn boy in the summertime and I painted houses for my cousins, and I tarred roofs in the summer time, to get money for my first guitar so I had a reason..<br/>\nWhat would I have done? I don't know. They're coming for me now (as we all could hear a siren from outside the theater).<br/>\nBruce said it took him about three to six months to bang out that first three-minute song from his guitar..<br/>\nTom then had them put up one of the pictures from Bruce's book, when he was with the Castiles playing the guitar on a lifeguard stand.<br/>\n\"Should I describe this?,\" Bruce said. \"This is how we opened the show. I have on a pair of sandals which I haven't worn on stage in a while, and I think I;m the coolest fucking thing ever. If you look you can see we are at the surf club, there are surfboards behind us.\"<br/>\n\"One of the earliest photographs where we can see Bruce got the guitar and he learned how to make it talk,\" Hanks said. .<br/>\nAsked about the Castiles and where the name came from and Bruce said the name came from Castiles shampoo.<br/>\n\"The first night we played a swim club and I made $5. I remember coming home and thinking 'Jesus Christ someone paid me $5!.\" And that was the best money I ever made, except for all the rest!\".<br/>\nTom said being at a Bruce show is like going to church and \"the preachers starts preaching right away. That set list is a moment.\"<br/>\n\"The thing is, being on stage, you either don't know what you're doing or aren't doing anything and it is terrifying,\" Bruce said. \"We kinda of come out and go into a protective crouch right away by trying to finish the job in the first three minutes to give you your money's worth and the rest of the night is on.\"<br/>\n\"We are all satisfied,\" Hanks said. \"We will follow you into hell sir.\"<br/>\nBruce then talked about what it was like playing in the Castiles.<br/>\n\"When you're starting out, you try to sound half-ass, all right and not embarrass yourself in front of the whole high school, CYO or YMCA. It's a big motivation at 15. You're feeling a strange empowerment that comes with a fucking guitar. All the sudden you are the prettiest girl in school. It's very strange, you come from the low end of the totem pole and the difference a few songs in a band makes.\"<br/>\nAt that point, Bruce stopped as he lost his train of thought and said \"What the fuck were we taking about?\"<br/>\nHanks then asked about Steel Mill:\"Did anyone actually see Steel Mill?\" he asked the audience and there were a few claps,.<br/>\n\"You become a quasi-legend locally. Jersey and Richmond are hotbeds of Steel Mill mania,\" Hanks said. \"You wrote original material with a band called Steel Mill and eventually drawing a thousand people to a show.\"<br/>\n\"We played some clubs where we could skip through with a good amount of original music but then if I I had to thrown a cover in, Creedence was always a sure winner,\" Bruce said. .\"That band worked real well for two or three years. It was kind of a heavy blues band, we played with our shirts off and our hair down to here. I had a Les Paul and a Marshall stack. The music was pretty original. You can go to Youtube and hear a ton of it is on there.\"<br/>\nBruce then said \"He's guilty, he's guilty\" and only a few people yelled out \"Send that boy to jail.\" to follow up on the \"next lyric\" game Hanks was doing. \"There was a lot of silence out there,\"Bruce said.<br/>\nTom then asked about Steel Mill being a democracy, not having Bruce as the dictator.<br/>\n\"Actually the guy who got the whole thing rolliing was Vincent 'Maddog' Lopez,\" Bruce said. \"He initially got me together with Danny (Federici) and Little Vinnie (Roslin). It was the four of us. I was originally going to join a cover band for the money in Asbury Park which i needed at the time. That didn't work out and we put together Child, then it became Steel Mill.<br/>\n\"After Steel Mill I decided I was going to go with my own band. Rock bands generally , you're in your 20s with all these misfits, people are hating one another, fighting, and getting thrown in jail, and you're bailing them out and another guy is going to jail and leaving marijuana plants on the front seat of the car. It was along list, these things were going on constantly and every day.<br/>\nA gentle, controlling hand is not such a bad thing.\"<br/>\nHanks then talk about Bruce's first album, \"Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.\"<br/>\n\"We were big big fish in Asbury Park and Central New Jersey and I had a lot of people telling me I was great and I chose to believe them, by the time I got to making the record,\" Bruce said. \"I had a lot of experience. I had been across the U.S. and back. I had been down south. I had a lot of road experience.<br/>\n\"I listened to the radio and said \"we're as good as those guys.<br/>\n\"When i made my first record, you're a combination of overflowing with confidence and a complete phony where it could fall apart in 30 seconds. I went in with these new songs and I thought they were pretty good.\"<br/>\nBruce talked a little about his tryout for John Hammond and CBS Records.<br/>\n\"I've been around eight or nine years and had made a living\" he said. \"If this doesn't work out I can still sing and play as when I walked in here. I will still be who I am. If they don't like us, nothing will be lost because we had nothing.\"<br/>\nTom asked Bruce why there is no guitar on \"Greetings.:<br/>\n\"I played one song, 'Saint in the City,' and John Hammond said, \"You got to be on Columbia records.<br/>\n\"There was no guitar because initially they wanted me to be a folk singer, and John Hammond wanted it to be completely solo album with just me in a guitar and we wanted it to be a rock record. We settled in the middle and I like how it came up.<br/>\n\"I was living in an abandoned beauty salon in Asbury Park, and there I saw the street characters who were in Asbury at the time, and the record got mixed up with all those people and that setting, it was semi-autobiographical. The music came out of the boardwalk and carnival life. It just comes to you.\"<br/>\nNext the talk shifted to \"The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle.\":<br/>\n\"The greasers who came down (to Asbury Park), they had no tans, just in their shark-skinned pants, They would invade the town on the weekend. All that came from life experience and a certain amount of imagination,\" Bruce said..<br/>\nHanks asked the crowd to tell the person next to you, your recollection of where you were and what you were doing the first time you heard \"Born to Run.\"<br/>\n\"It's a specific recollection! Is it not?\" he said.<br/>\n\"This is the moment for many of us when you transferred from the specificness of New Jersey to the heart and soul of Amercia.\"<br/>\n\"We made two albums and they hadn't done well and I was about to be bounced off the record label,\" Bruce said. \"I was thinking broader at the time. We had done some touring by then, we had been around the states, we were road dogs, I knew I had a foot out of the door. We always came back to New Jersey because we felt safe there.<br/>\n\" 'Born to Run' was just the next song I wrote. I didn't know if it was going to be a hit or if it wasn't going to be a hit. if you listen to something you think it's going to be good, but that hadn't been the case up to that point.\"<br/>\nBruce said 'Born to Run\" is \"cinematic!\"<br/>\n\"It came from life experiences from being in Asbury on a Saturday night when you had the circuit with all the hot rods going around and around on a Friday and Saturday,\" he said. \"That life was there in front of me and that came from every B hot-rod movie I had ever seen. \"Thunder Road\" (the movie) with Robert Mitchum played opposite Keeley Smith. I saw all, those B-Hot Rod pictures.<br/>\n\"The basic sound (of Born to Run) was wide screen. It gave you a world and a life outside of New Jersey.<br/>\n\"We were clueless about making records. Jimmy Iovine became the engineer, I don't know if he ever engineered anything before that.<br/>\n\"We could never get that sound again but we only had to do it once.\"<br/>\nHanks then brought up about Bruce not paying his taxes.<br/>\n\"A man also has to pay his taxes. Which you did not do until your entire life. Until someone said \"Hey Mr. Time Magazine cover,\" do you pay taxes?\" he said.<br/>\n\"We were Willie Nelson in reverse \" Bruce said. \" I never met anyone in New Jersey who was paying taxes. Certainly no one under 25 was paying taxes. Mike Appel, who handled our business, said 'I\"m not paying any fucking taxes.'<br/>\n\"All this time went by and no one is paying any taxes, some guy at the IRS must have gotten smart and then they came after us. I had to work for a couple of years for someone else every night. I didn't work for myself until 1980. I had to pay all the taxes. I had to pay, and bills I had to pay because I didn't pay any bills either. Then we had to pay for the lawyers, then we made records that were expensive because we didn't know how to make them. In 1980 I only had $20,000.<br/>\n\"You got to have the insane hunger, ego ambition, and desperation to take the chance, anything that comes your way and try to bust those doors down. I didn't pay any taxes, but I do now.\"<br/>\nWith which Hanks followed up with \"Although it's looks like you may not have to pay so much now\" to laughs from the crowd.<br/>\nIt was here where Hanks realized he had a lot more to talk about but only about 20 minutes of time left.<br/>\nHe touched briefly on \"Darkness on the Edge of Town\" and \"The River.\"<br/>\n\"One of my great mentors, Mr. Jon Landau, who was a film critic and he had me watch films.\" Bruce said. \"Tat had a big impact on me was John Ford's Grapes of Wrath.<br/>\nI wanted some of that in my music: \"The Promised Land,\" \"Racing in the Street.'<br/>\nYou tell a story to save your life. That's really what your motivation is.The writer tells a story to save his life, to experience life at its fullest. \"<br/>\nBruce said that \"Born to Run\" had one extra song (although the aficiondos say it's three). Hanks said \"Darkness\" had 57 songs and he had to cherry pick it down to 10 songs.<br/>\nHanks brought up \"the biggest record in Bruce Springsteen's career: 'Born in the U.S.A.' \" as he recited some of the lyrics to \"No Surrender.\":<br/>\n\"Steve convinced me to keep that song on,\" Bruce said. \"I thought it was too glib, I still think that. It's about the band and the brotherhood of the band and the fans, and at that time I gave him the benefit of doubt. I was always a little frightened of it. The whole record I have mixed feelings about.\"<br/>\nHanks asked Bruce about people misinterpreting the meaning of the song \"Born in the U.S.A.\"<br/>\n\"People hear the music, the beat, then they hear the chorus and if they have the time or inclination then maybe some of the the versus,\" Bruce said. \"That's the way the political rock and roll ball bounces.<br/>\n\"I still feel it's one of the best songs I've ever written. Something about the original recording I feel is at its best\".<br/>\nBruce then discussed about writing about Vietnam.<br/>\n\"I had some close friends, Bobby Muller, Ron Kovic, who came home in wheelchairs. I was a stone-cold draft dodger. I pulled the whole Alice's Restaurant. 'I'm sorry sir I don't understand what you're saying. I'm high on LSD.'<br/>\n\"I did the draft-dodgers text book and perhaps I felt guilty about that later. I had friends who went and died and who were seriously hurt. It was an event that defined a generation.<br/>\n\"It was something that had to be reckon with. Whether books or film, it was something I needed to sing about.\"<br/>\nHanks touched briefly on \"Tunnel of Love\" and \"Brilliant Disguise\" before Bruce wrapped things up with this:<br/>\n\"Musically we make our own little worlds, .we sell them to you, you can live in them, for a while. They can be important, they can get you through the day, though the night, they can change the way you think, the way you look, the way your dress, the way you approach your own life. Or it can just thrill you for three-minute of bliss, but they can't give you a life.<br/>\n\"At the end of the day we're all stuck on earth trying to carve out a life for ourselves. It took me a long time to learn that lesson, thanks Patti. It was a tremendous struggle for me. I found I like to happen to the world, we don't like the world to happen to us. I'm going to create my own new world, got to let the the chips fall where they may.\"<br/>\nHanks said he had notes on 11 more albums but he would not be able to get to that. \"You continue to talk to us on these records,\" he said. \"I think what you have done more specially for all of us, is you have made us part of something very good in ourselves.\"<br/>\nYes Bruce Springsteen has done that for all of us.</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Don't expect surprises; don't expect tributes to dearly departed artists. This is a set piece. It may evolve, Bruce may decide that a song doesn't underscore a story as well as a different one might and therefore replace it, but I don't expect change for the sake of variety.</p>\n<p>It felt like a theater piece. Bruce barely acknowledged the audience, performing his stories as an actor delivering a monologue would. His deliveries were polished, considered, and inflected. I wondered at times if he had worked with an acting coach, he sounded very different telling these stories than he has in tours past.</p>\n<p>The lights went down right at 8pm; Bruce walked out with no fanfare and dedicated the show to Tom Petty and then immediately launched into a monologue that painted a picture of what was to come. He spoke in the style and voice that he used in his book; certain passages were lifted verbatim from the book, in fact, and others were so much in that voice that you could be forgiven for not knowing when he was reciting the book and when he was expanding on it.</p>\n<p>It was immediately clear, even before the first song, that this was going to be \"Born to Run: The Musical.\"<br/>\nThat said, to me at least it did not feel nostalgic at all, the songs were in service of the story, and even old chestnuts sounded new and had deeper meaning when connected to his life's narrative.</p>\n<p>He played continuously, providing his own instrumental soundtrack for his stories, and when he sang, he wove together verse, chorus, and prose within each song. If you were there for the music, you might have found that frustrating, but this show is less for fans of Bruce's music and more for fans of the man himself. If you've ever wanted insight into the artist and his muses, this felt as close to authenticity as you are ever likely to get.</p>\n<p>There are some very light and funny moments, almost all self-deprecating, but most of the stories and songs are emotionally deep and cutting. (My favorite funny: early in the show, Bruce acknowledged, \"I have never done an honest day's work in my life. And yet, it's the only thing I write about.\")</p>\n<p>The first five songs comprised one long narrative flow, a first act, if you will, covering his childhood and coming of age. As I wrote earlier, \"My Father's House\" just shredded me. I wept openly. It's always been one of my favorite songs of his, and I've never heard it live. The narrative about his dad that he wove around it made it even more heart-breaking than it already is. The absolute highest highlight of the show, IMO.</p>\n<p>\"Promised Land\" through \"10th Avenue\" were a leap forward in time to the band years. Although I loved the performance of BITUSA sandwiched in between \"Promised Land\" and \"10th Avenue,\" it felt forced to me from a narrative perspective. It was a vignette (tied to the story of how he met Kovic) that didn't seem connected to the rest of the tale. Probably it was to illustrate where his social concern and activism originated from, but I felt like I had to infer that rather than feel or sense it.</p>\n<p>I loved the interlude with Patti. Seeing the two of them sing to each other songs that obviously hold so much meaning to them as a couple, when you're that close in a room that small, with just their two voices and two guitars, I felt almost an intruder. They were singing to each other rather than to us, and it was absolutely a highlight of the show.</p>\n<p>GOTJ through LOHAD represented the final act, less about Bruce's life and more about the issues he cares about. My one and only half-complaint about the \"setlist\" is that I thought DITD was very, very out of place. I absolutely loved the arrangement (the same as at Invictus the other night), but it was just strange sandwiching it in after GOTJ, and \"Long Walk Home\" and before LOHAD. I honestly don't know why he even has it in the show. Even his \"Put on your dancing shoes!\" lead-in was just weird in that setting. If it weren't for the fact that I loved the seamless transition from Dancing to LOHAD, I'd advise him to drop it. I'd prefer a fuller LOHAD to the combined Dancing/LOHAD.</p>\n<p>LOHAD itself, wow. I may be biased, as it's my favorite song of his, but the power he brought was incredible. Somehow, he summoned the band, and that abbreviated version felt for two minutes or so like an ESB encore. So powerful.</p>\n<p>BTR was gorgeous, very much the Tunnel arrangement, but with the \"Promised Land\" heartbeat outro (minus the abrupt twang, just a graceful fadeout). Maybe it was just me, but I felt like at the end of the song, everyone was singing (softly) along with the \"woah oh ohs.\" Bruce asked for the audience to be lit up for that last song (felt like an audible decision, but maybe not) so that he could see who he had been performing to.</p>\n<p>No encore, just bows, and a hasty exit, lights were up within seconds.</p>\n<p>I loved every moment of the experience. I was fortunate enough to score a front row seat right in front of Bruce's piano bench in the drop last week, and while I don't regret for a moment spending the money, I certainly think I would have been just as satisfied with any other seat on the main floor (I wasn't able to check out the view upstairs, so I'll let others comment on that).</p>\n<p>One last note re: the (presumably) unchanging nature of the setlist, I have tickets for later in the run that I was intending to sell after scoring the great ticket for last night. I'm not going to do that now. I want to see this show again. I don't care if it's exactly the same as it was last night, with seats that aren't as good, that experience was so powerful for me, the content so moving\u2026 like a great play, I could see it again and again.</p>\n<p>I was skeptical going into this, I thought it was an overpriced acoustic tour and that I'd end up having enjoyed myself but feeling vastly overcharged. I don't feel that way at all. I've not seen anything quite like this before, and I can't wait to see it again.</p>\n<p>Hope you get a chance to enjoy it, too.</p>\n<p>Merch: numbered poster run (2000), two tees and a sweatshirt</p>\n<p>Photography: strict, but plenty of people ignored it and took selfies before the show and photos of Bruce during final bows.<br/>\nI saw cameras come out surreptitiously during the show at times too.</p>\n<p>One important warning: you can't leave your seat at all during the show, even to use the rest room. If you do, you watch the rest of the show from the back of the house. No exceptions.\u00b4\u00b4</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Expectations were impossibly huge, and although I had soaked up every review I could find, knew what track list to expect, had heard an audio recording of an earlier show, and so I thought I was prepared, I had no idea of the reality. I'm still processing it, but want to attempt to make some sense while the memories are still fresh.

Again, 'wow' was all I could say to my companions, Janice &amp; Molly. I've been lucky enough to see Bruce in small venues before, and immediately I got a sense of how intimate and intense this was going to feel, but at the same time I could tell it would be special in a different way.<br/>\nAnyone who's been with me to a Bruce Springsteen concert knows my favourite spot is at the back of the pit, where I can relax, see everything fine (for photos and videos) and have space to enjoy the show with other like-minded friends around me. Fittingly, my seat in the theatre was the centre of the back row of the Mezzanine, so at once I felt at home; it was the equivalent of the back of the pit for me. With a well-angled slope of seats ahead, I knew I'd have a perfect view of the stage.<br/>\n8.05pm: showtime. A brief disembodied introduction, and Bruce walks onstage with his acoustic guitar. He launches right away into his spoken 'presentation', for want of a better word. It's not like a concert (although it's talking, music, and quoting from his book), although I have never felt more 'in concert' with Bruce on stage. Jon Landau referred to Bruce's career as a 'conversation' with his fans, but it's so much more than that, it's a RELATIONSHIP, for many of us unlike any other connection we have to our favourite musical artists; and this event is an extremely powerful re-affirmation, concentration and solidification of that relationship. If it was a marriage, it would feel like a renewal of vows. An early review wisely pointed out that previously Bruce's stories have served his songs, but here \u2013 and especially vividly in the first part of the night \u2013 it's the other way around. This really highlights how the two forms are not separate but united. 'Singer-songwriter' isn't enough of a title to describe what he does, he's a 'Songwriter-storyteller-singer'. Often the talking is underpinned by gentle musings on guitar or piano. His command of the audience never ceases to amaze me after all these years: there were one or two people who felt the need to whoop or call out now and then, but blessedly few, as this demands attention \u2013 apart from natural applause at the end of songs, instinctively it seemed right to wait for Bruce to cue us when it was appropriate to express ourselves, and this totally reinforced the intimacy and effectiveness, drawing us all closer together, hanging on his words. At times I felt as if I'd been holding my breath for much of the two hours and twenty minutes he was on stage.<br/>\nIn addition, of course, Bruce is a masterful musician and performer all at the same time. I am still impressed at the dedication and professionalism he needs to make this sound fresh and spontaneous night after night for what is still currently an indefinite run. It could so easily have become a static, routine performance this far into its course, but even though I knew Bruce would work hard not to let that happen, it's still remarkable how he can make you feel you're in a room full of people hearing him do this for the very first time. Part of this effect is created by what seems a genuinely thoughtful, often slow delivery, with quite long pauses in the middle of speech, as if he's formulating the words in front of you; it's totally convincing, even mesmerising. The lyrics are mostly faithful to the originals; occasionally a difference is apparent, such as 'rug mill' replacing 'textile mill' in 'My Hometown'.<br/>\nThe sound in the theatre is sparklingly clear and perfect, the acoustics so good that Bruce could step away from the microphones and address us a couple of times without any amplification. The lighting is simple but extremely effective; it changes so subtly you'd hardly notice. While singing about the desert, for example, the back of the stage has a sultry red glow like a sunrise or sunset. Bruce is often starkly silhouetted especially as a song draws to a close, fading to black before the next part. These elements make a huge contribution to the power of the experience.<br/>\nWaves of emotion are balanced with absorbed listening to his narration and singing. Just seeing the man walk on stage brought the first swelling to my heart; thankfully the superb pacing and structure of the sequence is such that it's not constantly overwhelming. New Jersey is playfully described as 'Jerzekestan', as in a small country that no-one knows much about. He joked after 'My Father's House' that we were 'off suicide watch', recognising the need for some levity after the intensely personal parts. 'Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out' provides the emotional core to the middle section: a long, rambling meditation on the importance and power of the magic of the equation 1+1=3, love, music, the band, and of course the Big Man \u2013 Bruce cued a huge, long roaring crowd ovation, reminiscent of the audience response on recent tours. You'd have to be made of stone not to react to that; for me, I felt my heart bursting at such a moment of pure connection and unity with Bruce and everyone in that room.<br/>\nWe know Bruce has so often reinvented \u2013 or more properly reverse-engineered - the arrangements of his music from band versions to acoustic performances. It struck me that there were many songs played which I'd never heard in person either on solo acoustic guitar, and particularly on solo piano. ('My Father's House' was an all-time first for me that night, finally completing my 'Nebraska' songs heard live after 36 years.) 'Born In The USA', remarkably, stood out for me even though I've heard him do several different acoustic versions over the years \u2013 it may be his most frequently changed song. Apart from the staggeringly intense, drawn-out blues slide guitar opening, I noticed that almost all of the rest \u2013 the vocal part of the song - was sung a capella (I think one of the only times I've heard Bruce sing a capella at any shows I attended was when he did 'Ain't Got You' on the Tunnel tour in 1988, 30 years ago). Such an arrangement was even more effective than ever at stripping down the song to its essential element \u2013 the story of its lyrics, with really minimal guitar touches for the most part.<br/>\nMidway through the night, Bruce takes a two-song pause from his solo presentation by bringing on Patti Scialfa for a demonstration of how he hasn't been alone in this, either professionally or personally. Fittingly, the songs they perform together are 'Tougher Than The Rest' \u2013 done with him seated at the piano, and her standing nearby so they face each other, giving the impression of a song which connects them \u2013 and 'Brilliant Disguise', chosen to reflect on their life since the initial connection, with all the challenges and complications that come with the risk of trust.<br/>\nThe second part of the evening seems to pass more rapidly, as it's dominated by the songs more than the stories which seem more prominent in the first section. True to form, Bruce draws the sequence to a close with the same immaculate sense of pacing he brings to any performance; letting one song flow into another is extremely effective to this end, such as the transition from 'Dancing In The Dark' into 'Land Of Hope And Dreams' (for once not introduced by its title) \u2013 the most intense and passionate performance I can remember of the latter, sung and played as if there's no tomorrow.<br/>\nNearly at the end, Bruce creates a pause as if he's back from the 'main set' for an encore, with a final speech, reminding us again of his words in the book on how his promise, his magic trick, is not just about his story, but our story, him and us helping each other together, and uniting us all once again \u2013 following his recounting of his career as what he calls a 'long and noisy prayer' \u2013 with the recognition that he has come full circle from his childhood in a small town dominated by religion, to a point where (always the Catholic) he is once again 'surrounded by God'. What more fitting conclusion to that 'prayer' than the universal one, the Lord's Prayer, which seems perfectly appropriate in this context, regardless of anyone's creed or beliefs. Only one song can follow that, and that's what 'Born To Run' does, an anthem brought home to its elemental centre, the quest for love. You want to know if love is real? There it is, flowing both ways. The lights go up, Patti re-joins Bruce for a minute or so while they take their final bows together, amid a frenzy of audience camera activity after the strict photographic ban during the show; she walks off, and after a few handshakes with some at the front, Bruce walks off too, and it's over.<br/>\nAs the arc of the stories and songs covering Bruce's career completes (for now), there's an unmistakable sense that this is a summary (logically complementing and following on from the autobiography), and like the familiar idea that at the end of things one gets the impression of your life flashing before you \u2013 as a long-time fan since 1976, I certainly had the effect of my 'past Bruce life' encompassed in these two-and-something hours. I know others feel the same, and potentially of course it's a sad, distressing idea to think \u2013 as we recognise \u2013 that something so special and essential has to come to an end sometime\u2026 but right now, let's not forget, the story \u2013 our combined story - goes on. I never see any point in speculating 'is this the last time?'; far better to focus on making the most of however long this continues. But while the inevitable awaits us all, as Bruce himself often ponders on our mortality, this is another (and a unique one) in a long line of gifts he's given us, a celebration of life, and love, and faith, and hope, and dreams, and reality; all the things that make existence precious and life worth living. I have seen Bruce many, many times, and marvel at how after all this time he has brought us something breathtakingly new and vital out of a collection of \u2013 on the face of it - old songs and stories. It's a magnificent feat, and for an old fan like me it feels like a baptism, a renewal, sending me forth to face life with new courage and resolve, living the shared story with my friends and loved ones, looking forward to our next rendezvous further on up the road. Yet again, I have been so fortunate, and am highly conscious of dear friends who would have loved to make it, but for whatever reason couldn't. I hope and pray that as many fans as possible get the chance to do this too. I have seen the past of rock'n'roll, and its name is Bruce Springsteen \u2013 on Broadway.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

It was an amazing night as I had already been to 129 Bruce concerts, but this one was so unique. Okay, so it was scripted, but there seemed to be a lot of spontaneity and - judging by the global audience - it was a fun, yet very satisfying evening. Not like the typical dance party shows that Bruce does, but this one was pensive and enlightening. It made me want to think about my own life and what I have done. Where I have failed and where I have succeeded. Where I have been and where I am going. At age 60ish, those are big choices for me - and a time to reflect. Bruce, if you are listening to me here, this show was long overdue and helped to crystalized the emotions of those of us who have been with you since, like me, 1975. One word to describe it: perfect. No politics (I worried about that) and all love (never a doubt). As I said at my first show reviewed on greasylake.org on 10.12.76 (you can look it up), the fuse was lit. And, the fuse is still burning. What a special night. Thanks, Bruce - we love ya - Ralph from Jersey, Delaware and points unknown (even to me!)

Such an emotional show. Bruce shed quite a few tears throughout the night as he recalled memories with his Dad, Mom and the Big Man. An unbelievable opportunity to see and hear Mr. Springsteen be so open, honest and spiritual throughout the course of the show. The songs are amazing, with \"My Father's House\", \"Born in USA\", \"The Wish\", \"10TH Ave.,\" \"Tougher than the Rest,\" and \"Born to Run,\" being highlights. The stories though are what makes this such an extraordinary and special show. Without his stories, it would just be a show with a man playing his music, but the stories are what truly cement the connection between performer and audience, as they reveal a person, really, not unlike ourselves. We all too have dreams, desires, goals, relationships, family, heartaches and triumphs. Mr. Springsteen's show makes you aware how special all those moments really are, as they make up the stories of our own individual lives. Thanks, Bruce!</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

You need your mobile ticket, vaccination card and photo ID. They do have people checking bags as you enter also. Once inside everything is coming at ya. The bar, the merch area, the theatre entrance, but the bathroom is across the hall and downstairs. About 5 minutes before it started Stevie came in to a loud cheer. NJ Governor Murphy was there as was Pete Buttigieg. The lights went down and out walked Bruce to a thunderous standing ovation. He looks good. Thin but not too thin and he looked happy. He showed about every emotion under the sun. He was fierce. More so than last time. The way he described things or tried to make a point it was like he was summoning up the strength to make sure we knew he meant that shit. He talked about the last year and a half, new E Street Band album Letter To You, everyone claps. His DJing on E Street Radio, everyone claps. his podcast with President Obama everyone claps. He finally \"said shut the fuck up and sit the fuck down\". He also asked fans who cheered and clapped every time he mentioned a city to stop \"Don't. Your city probably sucks, just like mine\" and yes even his arrest last November. \"The United States of America vs Bruce Springsteen\u2026 It always hurts to hear that.\" He was also extremely melancholy and although much of the show was the same a lot of things were added. Also much more animated. He made sure he reached even the furthest audience member. He stepped away from the mic a lot, to get you into the intimacy of it. When he spoke of his parents this time it felt like it went deeper and there was a tear or two go down his cheek a few times when overcome with emotion. He wiped his eyes several times. Patti joined him for Tougher Than The Rest (which he forgot a verse but Patti helped him out) and Fire which was fucking awesome, smokin' hot and playful. He then went into 41 Shots which was haunting and beautiful, and sadly still relevant 21 years after writing it. He ended the show with I'll See You In My Dreams instead of Born To Run. It was absolutely beautiful. His voice sounded beautiful. His voice was great throughout. It was a beautiful evening and being there with him felt good. It was like coming home. For those of you with tickets\u2026 some points below which should be helpful and for those who don't keep trying. If its at all doable do it! He did not stop and sign when he went in and I don't think he will at all throughout the run. He did shake hands with a few people stage right before leaving but. If you stick around after to see him leave stay on the theater side. They do have their windows open and Bruce is on that side. Most important and not at all surprising, Bruce has a monitor facing the stage attached to the front of the mezzanine with the entire show written out should he choose to look at it. As Thunder Road starts it's official. Mary's dress \"SWAYS!\" That's what was written and that's what he sang.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

This is now a fine-tuned machine that has some refined stories from the past show, some new stories, some new songs and for me, it's at a whole 'nother level.<br/>\nWhile Bruce has always given us 100%, I felt now, maybe because of the pandemic, him not being able to play, none of us being able to go out for more than a year , he's now giving 125%. Most of you who have been following the posts of the shows, know what's been played so I'll give you some different highlights for me and some unique things.<br/>\nThe start of the show is a bit different. Yes he does play \"Growin' Up\" but with a bit of a different intro.<br/>\nBruce talked about his DWI and said, \"I didn't wake up that morning and say to myself, 'I want to see what the inside of a New Jersey jail looks like!'\" He has a good sense of humor about the whole incident, but like most of us, you can tell he just thinks the whole thing was totally ridiculous.<br/>\nBruce talked about seeing Elvis on the Ed Sullivan show when he was seven and he said \"F*** Bonanza!\" I remember him in an interview once saying it was a battle for the TV on Sunday nights because his Dad wanted to watch \"Bonanza\" and he wanted to watch the \"Ed Sullivan Show.\" A funny incident prior to the start of \"The Promised Land\" (I think it was this song). Bruce strummed the guitar and it was a dud note. He looked to the side of the stage and said \"They're in panic mode right now. It's panic mode time.\" Kevin Buell then brought him out a different guitar and Bruce said, \"They're going to remember this. The time they were all in panic mode!\" When talking about his Dad, Bruce mentioned how his Dad had a bottle of Old Spice on the sink which always surprised him. Bruce said \"I always wanted to get on that boat.\"<br/>\nWhen talking about the cross-country trip with Tinker in late 1969, Bruce mentioned again about having no cellphone back then and expanded on the story a bit. He said back then, \"No one knew where you were and when you got home late, you were asked: 'Where you been?'\" He was very animated with his guitar during this.<br/>\nI thought Bruce really looked at Patti with such adoration during \"Tougher Than the Rest.\" Maybe it was that way in 2018 but I didn't pick up on it. I liked them doing the duet on \"Fire.\" Patti even solos on some of lyrics.\"<br/>\nOverall I thought Bruce was much more animated throughout. No tears tonight though, from the audience yes, but I didn't see any from Bruce.<br/>\nSome other notes: A lot of souvenirs. Caps, tote bags, shirts, key chains, two different types of posters (limit of two per person). Show started at 8:02 p.m. and ran about 2:33. The orchestra section of the theater looks similar to the Walter Kerr. It's the mezzanine and balcony that are bigger.<br/>\nBottom line: There's only 26 shows left now. Don't think about it. GO! There are still a lot of box office tickets for the July segment and early part of the August segment. The final show is sold out. And if you have the patience, there are bargains to be found on SeatGeek.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

This loose tone and surprising velocity (also notable on a speedy 'My Hometown') only made the moments where the show really slowed down feel more momentous, as when Bruce spoke (rather than sang) key lines in 'My Father's House' and 'The Wish.' Nor did the show stint on emotion: Bruce wiped away tears at several points during the night, and the performances of 'The Promised Land' and 'American Skin (41 Shots)' were exceptionally powerful. His humor was in full force as well, with an extended version of the bit about being arrested for 'moving after dark,' accusing the audience of being full of would-be 'night-movers' and calling back to his earlier comments on his 2021 arrest, joking: 'I'm working on a theme!'<br/>\nA few arrangement notes (not necessarily unique to this night): 'Tenth Avenue Freeze-out' was performed with slightly slowed down and simplified piano accompaniment, bringing out Bruce's soulful vocals and the song's elegiac role in the show. Similarly, the arrangement for 'Dancing In The Dark' has been adjusted away from the hard-strumming acoustic rock version of recent years to a tenser, somewhat quieter guitar accompaniment. Perhaps as a result, a full break occurred between that song and the still-hard-charging 'Land of Hope and Dreams,' in a shift from the first run's combined arrangement. A night of emotional twists and turns, often powerful, at times slightly jarring \u2014 but an absolute joy to see Bruce back chasing that one plus one equals three.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Bruce said she was taking \u201cCovid precautions.\u201d I saw the show July 1 and now tonight. Some quick hits: Some of the stories have been revised a bit. Bruce was in a great mood, very emotional not just about losing people in his life but reflecting on his great career and how he's grateful that we've been on this ride with him. After he said Patti would not be there, he said, \u201cI'm going to break my own rule\u201d and let us (audience) sing with him. He had the house lights turned on a bit and we all sang along on \"Fire.\" He waited for us to do the \"Romeo and Juliet\" part. It was a lot of fun. No \u201cTougher Than the Rest\u201d and no bonus song as he did when Patti wasn't there at the Walter Kerr Theatre shows in 2017-2018. So only 14 songs instead of the normal 15. But his stories were longer and the show ran about 2:25. A couple funny moments about his age. Bruce talked about how when he took guitar lessons at age 7 from Mike Diehl, that Mike was 70, but \"That's not that old,\" he said with a smile. He says he used to like being up all night and sleeping late, and now because of his age he's up early in the morning and \"I'm up about five times during the night. Jesus Christ!!\" meaning he's running to the bathroom. During \"Dancing in the Dark\" when he got to the line about \"You sit around getting older\" he then stopped and acted as though his back and everything else was hurting. Still real funny when he talks about is DWI arrest. Says \"It's the United States against Bruce Springsteen! That means every man, woman, child and even dog is against you!\" He once again emphasized \"sways\" during \"Thunder Road,\" stopping and repeating it. During \"Tenth Avenue Freeze-out\" when he mentioned the E Street Band toward the end he said \"and you will be seeing them again!\" It hit me during Bruce's into to \"Dancing in the Dark\" how he's really reflecting on life, career and even mortality. How we have to realize how special every day is. He mentioned how he is honored to have us there to listen to his music and be a part of his life. \"I'm happy that you can listen to my songs while vacuuming and doing the laundry.\" No handshakes at the end but he did take a little bit longer walking from one end to the other. No mention of Jessica winning the Silver Medal.<br/>\nOnly 10 more shows on this leg of the show. By all means see it. Just another wonderful treat this man continues to give us. Do not pass up this opportunity. As Seals and Crofts once sang, \"We many never pass this way again.\"</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

On a day which started with such shitty news about the loss of our dear Charlie Watts, Bruce new exactly how to cheer me up! I saw the show twice early in its initial run in November 2017 on my 20th birthday with my mom, and March 2018 with my dad, and both were absolutely incredible performances, as was the Netflix special! However, given the times we\u2019re living in this was truly unique. The Bruce was loose! He seemed so fluid and comfortable this time around! So much more passion, fun, joking, moving around, enthusiasm, and most notably emotion. Obviously, a lot has changed in the world since the first go around, and Bruce was up to the task! Although the majority of the show had stayed intact, a few songs changes were made, including swapping in a lovely and humorous duet of \u201cFire\u201d with Patti, \u201cAmerican Skin (41 Shots)\u201d addressing the injustices of police brutality and being black in America, and one of my favorite songs off the new Letter To You album \u201cI\u2019ll See You In My Dreams\u201d to finish off the show. Going back to the emotion Bruce did not hold back the tears, constantly choking up when talking about his late father and their rocky relationship, his beloved mother who\u2019s now 10 years into Alzheimer\u2019s, and of course the loss of former bandmates most notably The Big Man Clarence Clemons. Throughout the show though Bruce knew exactly when to crack a joke! Especially when addressing his recent arrest and the case of The United States vs. Bruce Springsteen on account of 2 shots of Tequila. He also changed up the way he addressed other jokes from the previous go around! The crowd was very into it nearly applauding everything he said, and hysterically during \u201cDancing In The Dark\u201d when the audience began singing along, he told us all \u201cStop you\u2019re gonna fuck me up!\u201d to which we all laughed and then he said \u201cAh fuck it\u201d and let us join along! The night was truly phenomenal! Bruce who is just less than a month away from turning 72, was clearly well aware of mortality including his own, and he gave everything he had into putting on a show we\u2019d never forget! While taking his bows he thanked us for being such a great audience and signed off with a short but sweet \u201cGod Bless Charlie Watts!\u201d. It was truly a night and day I\u2019ll never forget, and I\u2019m so grateful to have had the opportunity to go especially on the day where one of my other rock heroes had left this earth. It was a testimate that true rock and roll and true rock and roll bands will never die! If anything\u2019s for sure Bruce can lift anyone\u2019s spirits! Until next time Bruce, see you further on up the road!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Adam Weiner from Low Cut Connie played for about a half hour starting at 4 p.m. Bruce and Steve came on about 5:52 p.m. and were done about 7:10 p.m. There were 254 people in attendance for this benefit for Teachrock.org. The whole event was filmed and Steve said on Twitter it will be available to be viewed in a month or two. Bruce may have summed it up best at the end, after completing an hour-plus interview with Steve, he said: \"To share this friendship for 50 years is one of God's greatest gifts.\"</p>\n<p>I'll start with the details of Bruce interviewing Steve first, that was the finale for the evening. A lot of the interview for about the first 30 minutes was about the same as the internet interview from a few weeks ago. Bruce talked about meeting Steve at the Hullabaloo Club in Middletown, New Jersey. Bruce asked Steve about seeing the Beatles on Ed Sullivan on Feb. 9, 1964 and Steve said not only that, but the Rolling Stones came along four months later. Bruce said how the Stones were on Dean Martin's show and Dean crucified them. \"As much as I like Dino, I can't forgive him for that,\" Bruce said, followed up by Steve saying, \"Keith still hasn't.\" \"The Beatles revealed this world to us and the Rolling Stones invited us in,\" Steve said. Bruce then said had it was Elvis who he had his first epiphany. Bruce mentioned the Dawes song \"All Your Favorite Bands\" and the lyric, \"And may all your favorite bands stay together,\" and then saying, \"Steve and I are together 50 years after we started, and that's amazing. Here there's no retreat, no surrender, no compromise and no plan B. At the Middletown Hullabaloo something was irreversible forever at that moment.\" They talked about going to the Cafe Wha in New York City and Bruce mentioned how the took his kids there and it still looks exactly how it did in the 1960s. Steve talked about how Bruce was \"writing songs and was way ahead of me. It didn't occur to me to do that.\"Bruce talked about how \"Miami\" Steve came about, that Steve showed up one day in a Hawaiian shirt and \"was christened Miami Steve because he actually had been to Miami. Steve still doesn't like the cold, you go in his room now and it's fucking 90 degrees,\" Bruce said. They mentioned Steve being on the oldies circuit with the Dovells and how when that started in the 1970s, the oldies bands were only in their 30s at the time. How a TV show like \"Happy Days\" and the movie, \"American Graffiti\" helped popularize 50s music. The subject shifted to the Stone Pony and how Steve put together a horn sections for Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes. That Steve, Bruce and Southside saw Sam and Dave perform at a club in New Jersey and Steve said, \"we were going to be the white Sam and Dave and have a horn section.\" Bruce said how his first two records were bombs, \"but they were great music,\" Steve interjected. Bruce said \"'Born to Run' was a make-or-break record for him and if I failed I would have been back in Asbury Park.\" And Steve then said, \"You would have become a Juke\" to laughter from the crowd. That led to Bruce talking about how the song \"Born to Run\" took him six months to finish and he then picked up an acoustic guitar and talked about the minor rift in the song (the same he did on the internet interview) and how Steve helped him recognize that it was wrong. Then one of the most fun parts of the interview was when they talked about Steve's contributions to \"Tenth Avenue Freeze-out\" and how Bruce sent him to tell some of the greatest horn players in history to play on the song. \"It sounded just fucking terrible,\" Steve said. \"Bruce wanted Sam &amp; Dave.\" \"We wanted the Stax sound,\" said Bruce. Bruce became very animated talking about it and it reminded me of the Bruce on Broadway. It would have been a great addition to the show as he told a funny story all through and he was playing the guitar a bit, but that was it for the guitar playing. Steve said how it was great that \"Here was this shy guy who didn't say two words who became the world's greatest entertainer, next to me! Here's my friend walking on tables at the Bottom Line knocking people food all over. And how the look of the band on the first two albums was t-shirts and shorts and they looked like Jimmy Buffett's crew. After the look of Bruce's first two albums when 'Born to Run' came out, here are Clarence and I in pimp suits!\" he said. Bruce mentioned how 30 people each auditioned for Max and Roy's spot in the band and they wanted both to be singers too and \"they have never sang again,\" he said jokingly. Bruce said how they finally tasted some success and Steve said, \"Yeah my father started talking to me.\" Bruce told the story how when he was on the cover of both Time and Newsweek in the same week, that they were staying at the Sunset Marquis in Los Angeles. Steve came by with 20 copies of the magazine and was giving them out, but Bruce said he just wanted to hide in his room. The conversation shifted to Little Steven and Bruce crossing over Checkpoint Charlies into East Berlin during the original River tour and how that was a life changer for Steve (it's all in the book). Bruce talked about Steve leaving the band and \"I don't think Steve would have the fullness of his identity if he hadn't left the band.\" Bruce realized they already had talked for about an hour and said they would take the next 20 minutes for questions. However there was no one with a microphone so people shouted questions. The first one was: \"Bruce did you write Bobby Jean for Steve?\" and Bruce responded \"I will never tell.\" There were only two other questions and I don't really remember what they were. One was from a winner of a Backstreets contest. Bruce said that \"We'll be out in the world next year, we hope. And if you bring your kids, your parents, your grandparents, they will see the band at its peak.\"<br/>\nThe doors for the event were at 3 p.m. and there was a cocktail reception from 3 to 4 p.m. Adam Weiner from Low Cut Connie came on stage around 4 p.m. and played about eight songs on the piano including a nice, \"I Don't Want to Go Home.\" Next up was the panel discussion which wasn't really a discussion, but more of different people reading portions of the book. Before introducing the panel of Steve Buscemi, Jon Landau, Nona Hendryx and the afternoon's surprise guest Richie Sambora, Jon Stewart said, \"When I think of these literary events, I think of a Jersey bowling alley. And yes, I know what I look like right now. This is what happens when you leave Jews outside, we age like avocados.\" Richie Sambora spoke first, and the people at my table and later when I went out afterward with some friends, all thought that he was drunk. He just seemed out of it. Richie talked about sneaking into the Stone Pony when he was 16\u00a01/2 and going up to Steve Van Zandt and gave Steve a cassette of his music. Steve gave him feedback. \"He's was always gracious to a little kid and he taught me lessons,\" Sambora said. \"Steve became my mentors, he told me the truth.\" Jon Stewart talked about seeing the Bruce cover band Backstreets (now the B Street Band) at the Stone Pony and how they were cool to see except their Clarence was a skinny white kid. Nona Hendryx read a chapter and then Jon Landau came up. He talked about he and Steve and Bruce producing Bruce's records fto the mid 80s and they had some heated discussions but \"we all came out alive. Steve was always pushing Bruce on songs he thought were great. The goal was to aim for greatness.\" Landau said how recently he got a text from Bruce that read, \"Steve's book! Fantastic!! You got to read it!!!\" and how he then got the book from Steve and read it in a day and a half. \"I come up in the book a few times and Steve, if you're listening (he wasn't on stage yet), that's not enough times,\" he joked. Landau said he would read the part of the book where he's relevant. \"Jon Landau, King of Rock Journalist. Excellent!\" he said. He continued how Steve loved \"No Surrender\" but hated \"Dancing in the Dark\" and told Bruce it \"was a piece of shit.\" But Bruce loved it and we kept it in. Steve Buscemi read the part of the book about \"The Sopranos.\"</p>\n<p>Overall a great time. Really thrilled to have been able to witness this. Everyone got two copies of the book, one signed and some other souvenirs including a Little Steven cookie.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Bruce took the stage just after 10 PM, played four songs and told three \u201coff-color\u201d jokes. A few comments:<br/>\n- Bruce is ready to go on tour. At the end of Dancing in the Dark, you could see it written on Bruce\u2019s face, he was just getting warmed up, Bruce was ready to play more (at least another solid half hour), alas Bruce was \u201cushered\u201d off the stage.<br/>\n- Bruce looks amazing. The guy is 72, he\u2019s in amazing shape, I\u2019m 66 and I\u2019m not in such amazing shape \u2013 the Boss is Tour Ready.<br/>\n- I\u2019ll Work for your Love: the first song Bruce did. Having heard the song done with the band a few times (and at least acoustically once if memory serves), this was a great and an interesting choice. After seen Springsteen on Broadway in 2017 and in July, seeing Bruce doing a song with his guitar and not the band is always special.<br/>\n- Letter to You: I\u2019ve been blessed to having attended more than 200 Bruce shows, the number really doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s not some sign that defines how big a Bruce fan is. However, when you\u2019re hearing a song live for the first time; that\u2019s when there\u2019s magic in the night, those are the Bruce shows, I really love to be at. I love Letter to You, and I\u2019m pretty sure when we hear the song on the upcoming Letter to You Tour, the song will sound like it does on the album. That\u2019s GREAT and as it should, but a real and honest cherished nugget to hear it live with just Bruce<br/>\n- Hungry Heart: I\u2019ve heard Hungry Heart live many times, it\u2019s a great concert song, one that in the early 1980\u2019s served as a great \u201cbreaking the barriers\u201d between Bruce and his audience. NEVER have I heard the song acoustically (at least that I can recall) and it was really special, a five start treat from start to finish.<br/>\n- Dancing in the Dark: When Bruce talks about his mother and the challenges she\u2019s facing late in her remarkable lived life, Bruce, at least during Springsteen on Broadway, shares the love Adele Springsteen has for music and dancing. Bless you Bruce, I imagined Adele Springsteen\u2019s larger than life presence throughout the closing song.<br/>\n- All told Bruce was onstage for close to 30 minutes.<br/>\nAttending Stand Up for Heroes was and will forever be a cherished Bruce moment in time. I\u2019ve been so lucky to having been to having attended some amazing Bruce shows, Stand Up for Heroes joins that list</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

This was a contest through the E Street Channel and I would say about 100 people were there. It was the only screening of the movie in an actual theater which is a shame, because this movie is tremendous and really needs to be seen in a theater with the great sound etc. When you arrive and see Bruce's security director there, it's a pretty good chance that the man himself is going to show up, and he did. Originally they said doors were at 5:30 p.m. but they told us it would then be 6:30 p.m., then 7 p.m. and we were finally let in at 7:08 p.m. We got to watch and listen to Jim Rotolo do the final part of his Friday night \"Wild &amp; Innocent\" show. About 7:50 p.m., just to an entrance to the side of the movie screen, Bruce walked in. Most people couldn't see him because he was behind some curtains set up. As Jim finished his show (he was set off to an area to the left side if you were facing the movie screen) right around 8 p.m., he then came out to the center stage and introduced Thom Zimny and Bruce. They talked for a few minutes and you can see their discussion on the video I posted. After the short talk, Bruce and Thom walked right down the center aisle and took their seats in the theater, about halfway back. Bruce stayed until the end credits started rolling.<br/>\nNow the movie itself: Incredible, awesome, Wow, Wow, Wow! It's a shame that most of this footage has been in a vault for more than 40 years. But now with great technology it's well worth the wait. As Bruce said in the pre-movie discussion, he and the band \"were filled with youthful energy.\" Yes they were. The set list and some comments (thank you to Pete Maimone for helping me with these notes):<br/>\n1. Prove It All Night<br/>\n2. Badlands<br/>\n3. The Promised Land; Bruce dedicates it to Jackson Browne, John Hall and Bonnie Raitt. Before he starts the song someone hands him a birthday cake and Bruce says, \"Don't remind me!\" and tosses the cake back into the audience and says, \"Send me the laundry bill\" and \"I think I hit Steve's mother.\" Great footage of this throughout. Really intense.<br/>\n4. The River; I believe some of this same footage was originally in the movie from 1980.<br/>\n5. Sherry Darling; Bruce says: \"I'm officially over the f*** hill.\" and \"I need some party noise. I'm 30, come on you can do better than that.\" This footage has already been released. Lots of screams from the female fans at the theater to Bruce's dance moves.<br/>\n6. Thunder Road; The crowd in the theater sang along to much of it, especially to the \"Show a little faith\" part. Really cool shot of Bruce and Clarence up on Max's drum riser at the end.<br/>\n7. Jungleland; Some of the footage here was rough, but can't complain, it's all they most likely have. Audience all clapped at the end of Clarence's sax solo.<br/>\n8. Rosalita; Has the \"Stagger Lee\" opening. This was the highlight of the movie for me. A soon-to-be 30-year-old Bruce with the energy of a marathoner. Just running all over the stage. Similar to the great Phoenix 1978 footage. The band intros are fun, and when Bruce introduces Steve, he says \"the man who wrote 'I Don't Want to Go Home,' 'This Time It's For Real,'\"and then he goes over to Steve as he may have forgot what other songs he wrote. Steve says something to him, but I don't know if Bruce could hear him, so he says, \"and many other songs.\" The end, where Bruce and Clarence come together for the \"Bring It Up!'\" part is vintage. It doesn't get much better than this. Bruce jumps up on Roy's piano too. I wrote in my notes: \"Bruce is running around like a gazelle.\"<br/>\n9. Born to Run; Great as always.<br/>\nThe encores begin with:<br/>\n10. Stay; Bruce is joined by Jackson Browne, Tom Petty and Rosemary Butler. So cool to see them all so young and having so much fun.<br/>\n11. Detroit Medley; Fun, fun, fun. Bruce puts on sunglasses toward the end. Also does the emergency announcement shtick, and mentions how he and the band have an insurance policy if anyone wants it. Bruce and Clarence then have quite the dance moves which had the audience going nuts.<br/>\n12. Quarter to Three; Part of this was in the 1980 movie. Again fun, fun, fun. Then a surprise over the closing credits.<br/>\nI see it was advertised as among the songs included, but I forgot and was surprised when this came on:<br/>\n13. Rave On; The final song from the Sept. 21, 1979 show. Once again, Bruce so energetic.<br/>\nFinal thoughts: This is Bruce and the Band at one of the best points of their career. Young, hungry and so energetic. The ladies will definitely enjoy all of Bruce's dance moves as well the guys too. The movie is a combination of both the Sept. 21, and Sept. 22, 1979 shows. Some songs are from the first night, some from the second night. You can tell by what Bruce and Clarence are wearing each night. Clarence is in white one night, in red another night. One minor complaint which isn't anyone's fault really. Not much footage of Danny Federici. He's in a few of the clips, but Roy gets much more time than Danny. Also, some of the footage is raw. It's like you're seeing a rough cut at times, but hey, I'm just thrilled we got to see it. I would recommend getting this when it does come out next week. If you have a home theater, even better, crank up the sound and let it rip. The sounds is incredible. I don't know if it will ever be shown in a theater again, but that just adds so much to it.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Last night Steve Earle hosted his annual John Henry's Friends benefit concert, the seventh year of his fundraiser for the Keswell School for autistic children, and it was once again an in-person event after going virtual last year due to the pandemic. As is his custom, Earle invited a few guests to join his party, and this year's roster made it feel more like Bruce Springsteen's Friends. The evening's featured players \u2014 Earle, Rosanne Cash, and Willie Nile \u2014 all have a connection with Bruce, which led to much speculation leading up to the event about what special team-ups the evening might hold in store. There wasn't much speculation about the format, though. Fans could be forgiven for expecting another in the string of acoustic mini-set appearances that Bruce has been making this year. But this was no acoustic performance. After Cash finished her own acoustic set (quipping that she was about to hit Twitter to brag that she'd just opened for Bruce Springsteen), the members of Earle's band The Dukes took to the stage, and the audience knew something was up. Then Bruce entered\u2026 beat-up Telecaster in hand. And as a roar shook the house, we realized we were about to see Bruce's return to electrified, full-band, in-public rock 'n' roll for the first time since the pandemic began. The crowd went absolutely nuts. I have been to many Springsteen shows all over the world, but reporting on this particular event from the second row on the center aisle, I was completely unprepared for the reception and reaction that greeted Bruce on this night \u2014 and it seemed he was, too. The Bruce Springsteen and the Dukes performance that followed was half-celebration, half-catharsis for both artist and audience, and both made the most of every moment of it. First out of the gate was \"Darkness on the Edge of Town,\" performed with a ferocity we haven't seen from Bruce in years. The Dukes were more than up to the task of serving as Bruce's backing band in an intense performance. And if anyone was wondering if Bruce's voice is still up for the demands of a rock 'n' roll tour, his final \"towwwwwwwwwnnnnnnnnn!\" should put all concerns to rest, just as it knocked those present to their seats (momentarily). Next up: a celebratory \"The Promised Land.\" This one, of course, we heard nightly on Broadway, but it's easy to forget how powerful it is in its original arrangement. Once again, The Dukes impressed, although their lack of sax player meant a noticeable hole where our ears are trained to expect a Clemons solo. By this point security had lost control of the floor, the orchestra crowd had rushed the stage, and Bruce seemed to be relishing the energy up in the room. He launched into \"Glory Days,\" with Willie Nile returning to the stage to join him, but unexpectedly the audience decided to take matters into their own hands and sang the first verse to him, \"Hungry Heart\"-style. That was a spontaneous moment \u2014 I watched the musicians work out the arrangement at soundcheck, with no indication of a sing-along coming \u2014 and for a moment it felt like the next tour had already begun. Bruce capped his set with \"Pink Cadillac,\" performed as a duet with Earle, in a down-and-dirty arrangement that featured some terrific solos from The Dukes. Interestingly, three of Bruce's four song choices were part of his final pre-pandemic setlist (at Light of Day almost two years ago), so for anyone who pays attention to such things, there was a bit of a \"picking up where we left off\" feel to set, and it contributed to the overall sense that a tour must be\u2026 needs to be\u2026 imminent. After \"Pink Cadillac,\" Steve took the driver's seat for the remainder of the evening, ripping through a short but solid setlist of his own classics and some new music, too. Bruce returned for the all-artists finale: a rousing rendition of Graham Nash's \"Teach Your Children,\" which Bruce has only performed on once before \u2014 at another fellow singer/songwriter's school benefit \u2014 in 1986. Springsteen knew the song better this time, taking lead vocals on a verse himself. As the artists took their bows and Bruce and Steve Earle exchanged hugs, it sure looked from our lip-reading angle that Springsteen was urging the night's host to come join him at one of his own shows \u2014 an exciting prospect we have every hope of seeing come true in the new year.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

That video was recorded and looked like it was shot from Bruce's home. About an hour later, Debbie puts up another video of Bruce and her together from the Wonder Bar. I figured Bruce must have left if she put that video up. Then about a half hour later, someone else posted they were at the Wonder Bar and there was a special guest there too. I live five minutes from the Wonder Bar. So I figured I would go take a look to see if Bruce was still there. I drive by the back of the Wonder Bar and I see this orange open-air Jeep-type car that I know I've seen pictures of Bruce in before. So I'm thinking he's still there. Now the tough part. Getting a parking space. This is a summer Sunday afternoon by the beach. I drive around and around and finally see someone pulling out a block-and-a-half away. I got into the Wonder Bar and there's hardly anyone inside. I see Bruce is with Debbie in the Yappy Hour part outside where the dogs are. They were face-timing someone (one of the pictures I posted) on Bruce's phone. They then walk back into the bar, as I'm standing there, Bruce walks by, says \"Hi Stan\" and shakes my hand. I have met Bruce before, but I honestly never thought he knew my name. They go inside and sit at the bar. Jarod Clemons comes by and I took two quick photos not wanting to be stalkerish but also just wanting to show here was Bruce just sitting at the bar. He was with another couple. They sit for about a half hour, Bruce has something to eat with Jarod and no one is bothering them. Again there weren't that many people inside. Bruce asks for check, and someone (not Debbie) comes over and I think basically tells Bruce he never has to pay there. Bruce then pulls out some money, Debbie has come back over at this time, and he hands Debbie I believe it was three or four $100 bills to tip the bartenders and the staff. Bruce, the couple he's with and Jarod then go up on the Asbury Park boardwalk. I did not follow them up there. A bouncer from the Wonder Bar did follow them. I did speak to someone who joined up and walked with them (someone who Bruce knows) and he said it was such a mixed crowd at the Asbury Park boardwalk (it is quite the melting pot of people) that hardly anyone recognized Bruce. They then walked south and made their way back to the shops in the Grand Arcade of Convention Hall. Bruce had left a couple of bags at the Wonder Bar with some souvenirs and he came back to pick them up. Also his car was in the back. A few ladies asked Bruce if they could take a photo with him and he said \"Sure.\" I then walked up and took the photos instead of someone fiddling for a camera. Two others then came up, including Beth Ann, who got a photo. Then Ken Rosen and I asked him if we could get a quick photo and he said \"Sure.\" We were the only ones near him. It was very quick and he was very nice. No, I did not comment to him about ticket prices or anything along those lines. I was glad to see him in Asbury Park. It's a treasure when you have the opportunity to see him so down-to-earth like that.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

The world is in a state of flux politically and it seems that Covid has been a catalyst of polarization rather than a new sense of community that strives towards a better and safer world. The musical landscape, too, has changed \u2013 and not for the better. The domination of LN/TM of venues and ticket sales, the unreasonable cut (sometimes up to 70%) on merch has many artists struggling to survive and even caused bands to cease touring because it is cheaper for them to stop playing than to go out and work their asses off to create that connection only music can. It came as a great shock to many of us that Bruce\u2019s camp had decided to follow \u2018what the peers are doing\u2019 and to choose big bucks over the conversation of the past 50 years. I felt confused, shaken and betrayed. But we are talking the Boss here, my musical companion for 40 years. So I went to my only USA show with mixed feelings. Back home Springsteen\u2019s voice and his songs still hit me where it\u2019s real, but my faith got tainted: the ever-present morality in his songs is ultimately where I had found my firm ground all those years. What would happen when I looked him in the eyes after what had felt like such a betrayal, a slap in my face for taking his words as part of my moral compass for so long? Would all be forgiven? Or if not forgotten, reconciled enough to move on past the hurt towards a new horizon? The show to restore my faith was in Hollywood Florida, in a gaudy casino \u2013 nothing like irony, eh? I had the perfect spot to start my \u2018conversation\u2019 with Bruce. The band walked on one by one, each one briefly basking in their moment of glorious welcome. Finally, there he was: Bruce in sophisticated black, older, more fragile but still larger than life. His charisma shone all around him like a bright aura. He was less sure-footed than 7 years ago, and looked a little tired. But when he opened with No Surrender I was right back in my teenage room when I swore blood brothers against the wind \u2013 a promise not lightly made, a promise that I mean to fight for. A song that takes us back to Bruce\u2019s own promise too, when he was a youngster and set his sights on something big. The setlist appears quite static right now at the start of the tour, which might be unusual for our grandmaster of mixing it up, but I feel the setlist is deliberate and beautifully balanced. The progression makes perfect sense, musically as well as lyrically. So it was fitting and powerful that the song right after No Surrender would be Ghosts \u2013 where Bruce recalls his musical partners of yore and how the life affirming power of the promise he made with them still holds. The song rocks hard! Bruce\u2019s voice had a gravelly edge, which I like. Prove it all Night is really about the fire that comes with the promise made \u2013 I belted along with all my might. By the time Bruce sings Letter to You I believe his commitment, and I am right there in the moment. Promised Land and Out on the Streets both continue the theme of our commitment to rock and roll. Bruce misses a beat or two in the latter \u2013 Patti, Stevie and Nils mess up the sing-back \u2013 but Bruce is loose and laughs it off with that Scooby Doo chuckle of his, and I not only forgive him, I bask in the moment he shows us he is human after all. The songs follow one another non-stop and fast, with little room to breathe. I won\u2019t talk you through all songs, but instead I\u2019m going to jump to Kitty\u2019s Back, a rarity from his earlier years, now suddenly a staple in the set. With the present band this song makes complete sense. It is one of the back ends for the new soul songs Bruce wants to showcase, the other being the other \u2018oldie\u2019 The E-Street Shuffle. The horn players each grab their moment to shine, the backing singers are an outstanding force of harmony. For the first time Kitty makes sense to me: it fits, and I am enjoying every note, whispering Kitty\u2019s back with the singers (thinking tentatively \u2018Bruce is back\u2019). Then we get Night Shift, which lyrically harks back to some of Bruce\u2019s musical inspiration; not just Kitty, those soul legends are back too. Truth be told, I am not that partial to the album \u2018Only the Strong Survive\u2019. On record Bruce is slick and flawless, but the music fails to touch a nerve. Unlike the Seeger sessions, this record of covers didn\u2019t add much to the originals for me. I find I put it on as background \u2013 I mean \u2026 that\u2019s not happened before. Bruce says he wanted to showcase his voice: for me his voice was ALWAYS beautifully nuanced. I didn\u2019t need a record to convince me of that. Still, I love that first Marvin; it gives me delicious tingles all over. Let me tell you, live \u2013 oh boy live, the soul songs become the most enjoyable, rejuvenating part of the show. On top of that, the arrangements of the E Street choir are off the scale. Whereas Night Shift is introspective, Don\u2019t play that Song is a party song. It\u2019s hard to resist a Bruce who is like a little boy, goofing about \u2013 almost willing us to love it as much as he does. And you know what, there is no resisting such infectious enthusiasm. The whole band absolutely kills it, and just like that the \u2018soul\u2019 section has become my favorite part of the show. The abrupt \u2018philharmonic\u2019 start of E Street Shuffle serves to book-end the soul section and also take us out of that mood. We shift gears. And what a shift it is: the duet of Mansion on the Hill feels like a surprise to band, not in the least Patti. Both her and Bruce needed the auto-prompter for most of the song and at the start Patti is searching for the right harmonies. The under-rehearsed delivery gives us a glimpse into a private world I can imagine when the two of them sit by the fire with a glass of whiskey singing together and finding connection through song. Nils on the slide guitar \u2013 wow, what a treat this song is! Just like Candy\u2019s Room earlier, Johnny 99 \u2013 whilst 100% enjoyable \u2013 feels a little random in the conversation Bruce is communicating tonight. It is followed by Bruce\u2019s first bit of chat which introduces Last Man Standing. We are at the end of the journey. We began with a band of brothers swearing allegiance but now there\u2019s only Bruce left. The moment of reflection is a beautiful spiel about the virtues of youth \u2013 where it is all about looking ahead to an unobstructed open road \u2013 and burden of old age \u2013 which is mostly about losing the past. It is a reminder to live every moment, now. Backstreets builds on the breath we are taking. Bruce speaks about the souvenirs from previous band members / friends at his bedside in the middle of the song and with hand on heart swears he\u2019s gonna keep them there. His voice fades as he steps away from the mic, repeating the mantra, only to step right back to it with an almighty howl. If the pose with his guitar raised at the start almost felt like a gimmick, the howl goes right through the bones. Bruce continues with party songs that have long been the core of his performances. There are no surprises really. He might be trying to exhaust us, I am tireless. I know I will regret the jumping in the morning, but I ignore the ache and commit \u2013 I want to live the promise, be lost in the moment, where music opens my pores, makes my blood rush. I am in the now! Bruce is clearly loving being out there. The twinkle in his eyes when he and Jake have one of the many moments together is a dead give-away. He seems to revel in Jake\u2019s youth, and how Clarence is living on through him. In a show about mortality Jake \u2013 who has grown into them big boots with a pleasing confidence \u2013 acts as a death-defying presence. He is also a shoulder for Bruce to lean on a little as he stumbles back up the little steps after more lively songs. Suzie is not there tonight but the violin I have grown so accustomed to is aptly substituted by the horns and choir. A very slimmed down Steve feels a little more modest than in previous tours, but his connection with Bruce is loose and fun as ever. It is neat to see Steve directing the horns. And boy am I glad with the horns. Unlike the previous tour, Thunder Road is not the acoustic closer. Seven years ago we were still pulling out to win at the end, now the full-band song is back in the main set. There\u2019s nothing like closing the song with the stunning harmonies of the horns. Whoohooooo give me more! The songs that follow are the usual core end-of-set songs. I am a little sad we don\u2019t get more from Letter to You. That album holds out well for me at home; it deserves the spotlight and be the main body for the show. After all, we are picking up the conversation Bruce started with it. Maybe he thinks the record\u2019s too personal a contemplation. If anything, that personal touch is what I miss a little in the show. When Bruce goes \u2018small\u2019 is when he draws me in. The vulnerability of the more introspective of songs is where my connection with him is strongest. Instead we are Ramrodding through the set. The inclusion of it shows that Bruce is starting to take risks again \u2013 the band has not rehearsed the song but Bruce clearly feels confident to play what the moment \u2013 the now \u2013 calls for. It is a much shorter version than previously though. No booties are shaken but it is raucous and uplifting. The end of the set aims to pull in the crowds one last time. For me there is plenty on Letter to You to create a similar atmosphere, and dare I say it: a firm personal favorite from Western Stars, Sleepy Joe\u2019s Caf\u00e9 would absolutely fit, especially since we have the horns! Still, all is made good with Bruce\u2019s decision to leave us with a solo acoustic See you in my Dreams. Curt Ramm\u2019s solo, so reminiscent of the Last Post gave me goosebumps. This ending brings us right back to where the story began at a few minutes before 8: a promise to not surrender, only now that promise is renewed with a vow to meet up again in dreams and even that moment where time will stop, too, for Bruce. But I\u2019m not even contemplating that \u2013 I\u2019ve got a European stretch coming up. Seven years ago the awareness of mortality was present in the shows but Bruce was still running from it; there is more acceptance of the inevitably of it now. And when we embrace it like that, means we can live without regret. I don\u2019t regret spending half a month\u2019s salary on a ticket, the rest of it on travel and accommodation. I needed to reconnect and the only way was through Bruce\u2019s music and him singing it to me. Faith in the music and the magic in the night was restored in Hollywood. My love is not quite as \u2018blind\u2019 as before, but I am willing to swear blood brothers again. Connecting with Bruce in Hollywood was healing. I am glad I went. Bruce clearly has rediscovered his mojo! It is great to feel the energy. He\u2019 ready for it. So am I. I\u2019ll continue the road in April, from Barcelona onwards. Bring it on Bruce!<br/>\nDespite the lack of regret, I still think Jon Landau is wrong: this concert was not worth $699 (will you stick to your money-back guarantee Jon?). Frankly, no artist is. It is obscene. Music is too important to turn it into a rich man\u2019s game. The musical landscape has changed, we owe it to our children to reclaim it. I hope Bruce will have enough time left to readdress the balance and use his undeniable class and track record to recreate the landscape of opportunity for the younger generation of musicians and their fans.<br/>\n<sup><em>Taken from: <a href=\"https://twomuppetsontour.wordpress.com/2023/02/10/lay-down-your-money-and-place-your-bet/\" target=\"_blank\">Two Muppets on Tour</a></em></sup></td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Some thoughts / observations:<br/>\n[1] No mention at all of missed shows or who may have been sick. At the open Bruce sounded very rough, but as the show went on his voice returned to how it has been for the other shows we have seen, and by I'll See You In My Dreams he sounded good. It will be interesting to see what NUGS does with the open of Ghosts which was sung in the key of LMNO \u2014 so much so that folks were looking at each other wondering what the rest of the show would be like. I wonder if they will dub in the line from another show, or send it out as is.<br/>\n[2] The energy of the Philly crowd was great \u2014 as it always has been \u2014 and almost everyone was standing right up to the last row top in the 300 sections - unlike the other non northeast shows I have seen. The folks around me (section 112) were long term fans IMHO in that they knew the words and changes for Kitty and E Street Shuffle \u2014 and also Trapped wasn't a mystery to them. Best crowd of my shows so far by far (Tampa, Atlanta, Orlando, Denver, Philly) \u2014 and of course not a surprise.<br/>\n[3] The band all looked fine and nothing obvious as to who was sick. Max did look a bit more exhausted by the end of the show then he has and my wife felt he might have been among those who were sick. But he was spot on all night until the end.<br/>\n[4] While i was hoping for a bit more variety, I still loved the show - sorry the set listed LOHAD wasn't played. The Last Man Standing into Backstreets was particularly powerful for me last night \u2014 and the energy in the arena during Badlands didn't seem like 2023 but was reminiscent of the old days. I have always enjoyed Trapped since first hearing in Syracuse in 1985 and last nights version was strong. Bruce did seem spontaneously happy during the crowd sing along of Thunder Road. Although redundant for me, the closing run of songs from Thunder Road to the end (actually even from Badlands) was well appreciated by the Philly crowd.<br/>\n[5] Bruce is the Boss, and has paid the cost to be the boss. He is performing the show he wants to right now \u2014 in the way he has planned - sending the messages he wants \u2014 and ending it with I'll See You In My Dreams to send people home \u2014 Even In Philly. It was pretty clear to me that nothing too special/different was going to happen in Philly, so the show matched my expectations. No whining or open letters from me.<br/>\n[6] I walked around the arena for a bit outside before doors opened. This is the first show I can remember where I didn't see any of the \"usual suspects\" outside [magic marker man at the GA line (which BTW was short even at 6:00), the \"walking wounded\" waiting to be wheeled into their rightful spot at the stage, etc ] \u2014 but sadly also none of my SPL friends other long time Bruce fan friends. A mixed bag from that viewpoint.<br/>\n[7] I remain optimistic that by the time the tour heads to EU and then returns for the summertime shows The Boss will feel he has had enough delivering his current theme and message, and we will see a much different show perhaps still incorporating some of the current elements and themes. The band IMHO is now hitting on all cylinders and could certainly handle other songs on short or even no notice \u2014 when Bruce is ready for them to do so.<br/>\nHeading to State College Tomorrow, because I am still a prisoner of Rock And Roll.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Right at the beginning of the show Bruce went to hand me a guitar pick. The lady standing next to me grabbed it. Bruce just looked at me and I mouthed \u201cit\u2019s ok\u201d back at him. Yeah I was a little annoyed but let it go and was just happy he acknowledged me. At the end of the show after The lights came on one of his security people came over to me and handed me a guitar pick. I thanked him and he said \u201cDon\u2019t thank me it\u2019s from Bruce he says he is sorry she took your pick\u201d I was so shocked that Bruce went out of his way to make it right that I just stood there and cried. I love that about him. With all of those people and all of the madness going on he remembered me and made sure I got my pick. To the lady that took my pick. Thank you.

Took the bus from NJ to Port Authority, subway to Grand Central, and the LIRR to the arena. The train station is about a half mile from the arena, who the fuck drew this up? At least they had shuttle buses that deposited you outside. Walked around a bit and went in around 7:05. Met up with Hobbes and Bossman284 while I was having a beer pre-show. I bought my single during a drop on TM a few days ago, Sec 101 right next to the stage. I thought it was an aisle seat but it was the last seat in the row with a barricade next to me. So I was basically right behind Roy, overlooking Steve's guitar tech, and other techs, real good spot to watch a lot of the things going on. VERY close to the stage. Was able to zoom in on a couple of copies of the setlist. Excellent show, I was also at MSG, and I would say if it wasn't for Jungleland this one was better(for me). As noted in prior shows, Steve was having issues with his amp again, could see him shaking his head, making guitar changes in the middle of songs, etc. The backup singers, in particular Michele Moore, were very friendly and making eye contact and pointing at people when they were onstage. The crowd around me was great, except the POGO jumper immediately to my left who kept banging into me and basically invading my space. Nice to hear Trapped and Lucky Town. I know they were played before but not that often that's it nice to hear them. Since I knew it was coming BITUSA was not a surprise but really nice to get a new song. Usual encores. Getting out of the arena took awhile. I was afraid of going home the same way I came and HeyEddie graciously offered to drive me home as it was on his way. I met up with him, his lovely wife Jodi, and Essexboy in the parking lot. It was a pleasure to finally meet Essexboy after all these years. So here I sit, relaxing with a nice cocktail, and in the afterglow of the show, haha. It cannot be said enough, even with the semi-static setlist, GO SEE THIS SHOW!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

As most know, for reasons they said were COVID, Bruce and Patti, who were supposed to be presenters, were not there. Bruce did introduce Darlene Love and Steve Van Zandt in heartfelt video speeches and even Jon Stewart, the emcee mentioned a couple times how great Bruce looked and sounded for someone who has COVID. Overall still an outstanding evening with great food, camaraderie, and great musical performances. The evening began with a reception in the Great Hall at Monmouth U with outstanding food and open bar. Sam Moore, Darlene Love, Steve Earle were there as well as Garry Tallent and Jon Landau. Everyone then moved over to the Pollak Theatre for the actual ceremony which started about 8:45 p.m. They did lock up our phones for this portion so you won't see any photos or videos. Although the event was filmed and a few photographers were taking pictures including Danny Clinch. Adam Weiner of Low Cut Connie was sitting right in front of us and introduced me to his father. The Disciples of Soul were the house band and they came out and did a few songs (without Little Steven) to start the evening. Jon Stewart then came out and told some jokes. He then told those who did not know that Bruce and Patti would not be there. I had first heard about it about 5:30 p.m. when a friend messaged me. Bob Santelli, the executive director of the archives gave a short speech. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy spoke and shared a proclamation that from now on, Sept. 23 will be Bruce Springsteen day in New Jersey. Garry Tallent then introduced Steve Earle. They both gave nice speeches and Earle then sang \"Copperhead Road\" backed up by the Disciples of Soul. Next up was a video message from Bruce, who talked about how he was with Little Steven in Los Angeles in 1982 and Steve said he had a surprise for him that night and took him to the Roxy to see Darlene Love. Bruce then talked about her background, how she struggled and how she made this big comeback with help from Little Steven and others. Darlene gave a very heartfelt speech saying \"it's a thrill to be in the midst of all you wonderful fans.\" She then performed \"River Deep, Mountain High.\" Originally Patti Scialfa was supposed to present Darlene. Jon Stewart came back out and said \"It's amazing how Bruce looks and sounds like that with COVID.\" Southside Johnny then presented Sam Moore. who at 87 still sounds great. He walked onstage with a cane and with the help of his daughter. He was funny in his speech. He performed \"I Thank you.\" When he was done, Sam's grandson and granddaughter came onstage to help him off and the granddaughter was wearing a shirt that read \"I heard Bruce might show up.\" Sam read that and laughed. Next up was Bruce, via video again, presenting Little Steven. He talked about when he first met Steven and the long journey they have been on together. When Steven came on the stage he said, \"Bruce, he does look healthy, you son of a bitch!\" Steven talked about TeachRock and how important that curriculum is for schools today. Steven then led the Disciples of Soul in a performance of \"Bitter Fruit.\" Then Steve said, now the jam session, which was great. Darlene Love sang \"Hungry Heart.\" Steve Earle, Southside and Steven did \"It's Been a Long Time.\" Sam Moore came back to do \"Soul Man.\" They also played \"Tenth Avenue Freeze-out: and the finale was \"I Don't Want to Go Home.\" I kept thinking how this was a great jam session but how much better it would be if Bruce was a part of it. And here's a Spring-nuts group shot from the evening. Howie said it was like we were at a wedding or a funeral, I felt like it was prom night.</p>\n<p>Set list (as taken from BTX)<br/>\n1.

As mentioned before, I\u2019m getting too old for this shit but I keep on keeping on, as you do. On the way to the venue, we took a detour to Palau Robert to check out the great exhibition of photographs by Francesc Fabregas from Bruce\u2019s first Barcelona show in 1981. While there, we met our old friend Salvador, who contributed to and collaborated on the project. After that, it was back on the funicular to Montjuic to join the long and winding GA queue, which snaked around the stadium and curled back on itself at one stage. Organization did not appear to be a strong point. Those with pit tickets and normal GA tickets were required to join the same queue and would apparently be divided up later. There was a disturbing lack of stewards, informative signage, toilets and crowd control barriers, with ever-present opportunities for people to push in. As did four loudmouthed drunks from the UK, right in front of us. Cheers guys. Luckily we lost them later. It was otherwise a pleasant sunny afternoon in the company of thousands of others just like us, eagerly anticipating an E Street show for the first time in over six years. After a seemingly interminable circuit of the entire sports complex around the stadium, up and down numerous flights of steps, we were finally split up into designated lanes, fitted with wristbands and allowed into the back end of the stadium. We then had to walk the length of the field to gain access to the pit. We\u2019d hoped for a comfortable position at the back, but it was already very crowded there (and would get worse later), so we decided to head for the far right, where there was an all-important barrier to lean on or sit against, plenty of room to move and a great uninterrupted view. And there we stayed, relaxing and talking to friends who passed by (Danny, Sergio, Malcolm, Paul, Beverly, Laurie, Roger, Winni) until just before 9, when the stadium lights dimmed to a deafening roar from one of Bruce\u2019s most fervent audiences, and the first show of his 2023 European tour got under way with No Surrender. I don\u2019t intend to bang on for too long about the gig because many of you out there will already know everything about it thanks to the interweb and my main priority today has been to celebrate my birthday once I woke up. Suffice to say that it was a powerful performance, the band were firing on all cylinders and Bruce appeared to have lost little of his vocal power since he last toured with E Street. The sound was excellent from our position, as was the lighting. The basic set hasn\u2019t seen any significant changes since the tour began in February, so it was nice to get the tour debut of Human Touch, with hundreds of cellphones held aloft. Patti Scialfa usually features on that one, but she only turned up to sing backing vocals on Glory Days with friends Michelle Obama and Steven Spielberg\u2019s wife Kate Capshaw. Having started this journey over 40 years ago, and being a fan of the early 70s material, it was wonderful to hear Kitty\u2019s Back and The E Street Shuffle, not to mention Backstreets and She\u2019s The One. Admittedly I was less enthused about Mary\u2019s Place and the BITUSA material, but to each his own. The inclusion of songs from Letter To You was always a bonus, and the solo acoustic (often less is more) Last Man Standing and I\u2019ll See You In My Dreams were among the highlights, with the lyrics (and spoken intro) translated in Catalan on the high-definition screens. Throughout the set, Jon Landau wandered unrecognized around the pit, passing close to us on several occasions. The show seemed to fly past, and before we knew it, Bruce was saying goodnight as midnight approached, our first taste of the new tour in its outdoor phase (the default setting in Europe) at an end. The long trek down to ground level with thousands of others was another test of endurance, as we traversed hundreds of steps (and rode on the occasional life-saving escalator). By the time we got back to our apartment around 1.45, my knees were screaming for me to get horizontal. In the past, we took long hours of queueing and challenging locations in our stride, but as the years pass, they become more of a struggle. What we once didn\u2019t even think about is fast becoming unthinkable. After spending a while on our favorite balcony discussing the show, we finally retired to bed around 2.45.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

We woke up on the morning after my birthday to bright sunshine. We\u2019d had a downpour while out for an alfresco meal on Saturday evening but initial forecasts of thundery rain throughout Sunday had now been downgraded to drizzle or occasional light rain during the show, or no rain at all. So after a few hours spent relaxing, Dan, Deirdre and I took a chance and set off dressed for dry weather. Big mistake.<br/>\nIt was easy to get to the stadium from our place. Short Metro and funicular journeys followed by a 10-minute walk and we were there. This time we found the combined pit/GA queue snaking down the approach road instead of around the stadium. The aforementioned inefficient system of no marshals, toilets, barriers or any useful information was still in place. As we joined the line, we heard Bruce and band playing Lucky Town at the end of the soundcheck, which we later found out also included My Love Will Not Let You Down and I\u2019m Goin\u2019 Down. It was sunny when we left, but there were now increasingly dark clouds looming directly overhead. They\u2019ll soon pass over, I said unconvincingly. Minutes later there was a biblical downpour, accompanied by the occasional rumble of thunder. According to Audrey Hepburn, the rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain, but now it was chucking it down on the mountain. Those who were less meteorologically optimistic had brought plastic ponchos, but the rest of us (with literally nowhere to hide except the doorway of a nearby museum and a couple of bus shelters) had to stand there and get soaked to the skin. A process that didn\u2019t take very long given the torrential nature of the precipitation. It put a literal dampener on what originally promised to be an exciting anticipatory afternoon. To be frank, we were suddenly thoroughly f-ing miserable and pissed off. At one point, we seriously considered leaving to watch Spanish TV at the apartment, which would have been preferable to being the first Bruce fans in history to drown standing up.<br/>\nThe rain continued in various strengths for over two hours, lessening off, then coming back with a vengeance, while we crawled around the stadium complex as we had on Friday, making our slow, soggy way to the main entrance, wondering about the cost of trenchfoot medication in Spain. It was zipped up inside my neck pouch, but my ticket, an A4 inkjet printout, was soaked. The barcode had miraculously survived but the electronic reader didn\u2019t recognize it when I finally got within sight of the gate. (This was apparently a problem on Friday too, unrelated to the weather). The woman tried three times, then waved me through. If I\u2019d been refused entry at that point due to a waterlogged ticket, somebody might have got hurt. Dan\u2019s Metro ticket, which was thicker, had disintegrated completely. Luckily I\u2019d wrapped my phone and camera in a sandwich bag. Trudging dejectedly into the stadium, we settled in the exact spot we had on Friday, to the far right of the pit, where Ekaterina joined us. Sitting on the ground wasn\u2019t an option, so we just had to stand there, dripping. If the merch outlets had sold towels, they\u2019d have made a fortune. While fans flooded in with their umbrellas and plastic ponchos of various hues, the screens displayed details of the stadium evacuation procedure should it be required, suggesting that a storm may be imminent, but thankfully the rain stopped before showtime, the sun appeared briefly and a rainbow formed above us. The cool air gradually dried us out as we shivered in our inappropriate and insufficient clothing, but our shoes remained soaked. I was sure some kind of fungus was growing in mine, or maybe a brand new variant of pond life. Having dry fingers finally allowed us to operate our cameras and phones again. Some of my photos can be found below.<br/>\nLuckily, we didn\u2019t have long to wait until the gig after the extended slog into the venue. Bruce hit the stage around 8.55 to another massive roar from the huge crowd, whose enthusiasm hadn\u2019t been dampened even if their clothes had. As hoped, despite static setlist syndrome, the second concert had several notable differences from the first, opening with My Love Will Not Let You Down and including Trapped, Johnny 99 and a rare Ramrod. Again, the band solos and horn arrangements in Kitty\u2019s Back and The E Street Shuffle were highlights for me, as was the solo acoustic Last Man Standing into Backstreets. The clips of Clarence and Danny on screen during Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out were a poignant reminder of the show\u2019s underlying theme of mortality. Running close to three hours with 29 songs and eight encores, it turned out to be the longest concert of the tour so far, some kind of compensation for our earlier ordeal. The sound, lights and three big high-definition screens were excellent. No celebrities made it onstage this time, but Tom Hanks and wife Rita Wilson (dry as a bone of course) were seen having large amounts of fun at the mixing desk before being escorted by security past us through the pit to the backstage area. We also saw Jon Landau walking around the pit again and Thom Zimny and his crew rushing past. It was good to run into Laurie, Paul and Malcolm (with Brenda) again, and to see Mira Belle, Suso Peter Bl\u00f6chliger, Jose Ramon Cervera, Caroline and Ralph, and Philip Jump and Cinzia for the first time. Sorry we missed you, Anna, Brenda and Carina.<br/>\nBruce finally walked off around 11.50. In the past, we might have stuck around to clap for another encore, but enough was enough. We were happy to leave as fast as possible and begin the long trudge back down to the Plaza d\u2019Espanya. This time it only took us 45 minutes, instead of around an hour, to wind our way down the endless series of steps and escalators to ground level. If there is a next time, we intend to shave another five minutes off our record. And we\u2019ll bring canoes, just in case. The Metro closes at midnight on Sundays, but because Monday was a public holiday, it was running until 2am. A much better prospect than trying to squeeze onto a night bus, find a taxi, or in the worst case scenario, walk three miles. After waiting for a human bottleneck to clear, we made it back to our apartment by 1.45 for a hot shower (we gave it full marks for its easily understood controls) and beer, pizza, ice cream and coffee. After chatting about the day\u2019s events, we crashed out at 3.45am.<br/>\nThe three of us were up again at 9am on Monday, for breakfast on my favorite balcony. If Bruce had played in the caf\u00e9 across the tree-lined street below us and the Sagrada Familia had been dragged three blocks north, I might have stayed on that balcony for six days straight, watching the world go by. I wanted to fold it up and bring it home with me, but it would have exceeded cabin baggage requirements. Deirdre still had a few hours before flying to Dublin, but a taxi arrived at 10.45 to whisk me and Dan to the airport and back to reality, our six-day Barcelona trip now sadly complete. But as I always say, you have to come home so you can go away again. Real life is just a temporary phase between the good times. Before we left, we used a heater to bring our shoes to an acceptable level of dryness for travel, but they still smelt musty and damp. I won\u2019t even mention the condition of the socks we\u2019d worn inside them at the gig.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

        "table": "<table style=\"width: 100%; border-collapse:collapse; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto\">\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Stan Goldstein</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Not even sure where to begin to talk about today's \"Wild, The Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle\" 50th Anniversary Symposium at the Pollak Theater on the campus of Monmouth University. It started at 9 a.m. and ended about 6:20 p.m. In that time there was nine different panels with Bruce Springsteen on two of them. There was also a music performance of each of the songs on the album at the end, Bruce didn't play on any of those. Maybe the highlight of dozens of highlights was when our own Tom Cunningham, who was moderating a panel with Bruce, Garry Tallent, David Sancious and Vini Lopez about the making of the album, mentioned that Patti Scialfa will be inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame tomorrow. Bruce then pulled out his own cellphone and asked everyone in the audience to say \"Congratulation Patti!\" and he filmed it for her to see.<br/>\nSo let's talk about Bruce first. It was pretty well known he was going to be interviewed by Bob Santelli about the writing of the songs on the album. He came out to a standing ovation and a day that was already pretty special got taken to another level. There's a lot to cover, I did film some of it, and these are just some of my highlights from my notes: Bob asked Bruce how he was able to work so hard on this right after \"Greetings\" came out and Bruce said, \"I was 24 years old!\" Bruce said his first contract stipulated he was supposed to put out a new album every six months, Bruce said he wrote a lot of \"the Wild &amp; Innocent\" while living in a garage apartment a block from the ocean, just down from the synagogue on Fifth Avenue in Bradley Beach (down the driveway at 205 Fifth Avenue for those who want to know!) Said he wrote \"Sandy,\" \"Incident on 57th Street\" and \"New York City Serenade\" while living there. He talked a bit about the cover of \"Greetings\" how he found a postcard on the Asbury Park boardwalk and handed it in to the art director. He said for his second album he liked the way \"The Wild &amp; the Innocent\" played off of \"The E Street Shuffle\" for the name. Also how the song \"E Street Shuffle\" was taken from Major Lance's \"Monkey Time\" and the end is like the end of \"Move On Up\" by Curtis Mayfield.<br/>\nThe conversation shifted to Bruce talking about his first trip to California with Steel Mill in 1970 and he found bands who were better than \"we were. We were good but not good enough.\" He said David Sancious \"is an incredible musician\" and when Boom Carter joined they were \"a great little band. We swung a different way for about six to eight months.\" He said about the British Invasion: \"I wasn't interested in the British part. I'm an American rock and soul artist who liked Roy Orbison, Motown and Stax records.\"<br/>\nBob Santelli mentioned how Asbury Park's Convention Hall had some great shows in the 1960s: Rolling Stones, Doors etc. Bruce said he did see the Doors there and he saw The Who open for Herman's Hermits. He said parents who took their kids to see Herman's Hermits were stunned when the Who started breaking their instruments. \"What the F is going on they were saying.\" Bruce said \"Kitty's Back\" was \"a distorted piece of big band jazz\" and mentioned how \"Rosalita,\" \"Thundercrack\" and \"Kittys' Back\" were showstoppers. They showed footage of the band playing at the Ahmanson Theater in Los Angeles in 1973 earlier in the afternoon and Bruce said they had to come out right after Edgar Winter played \"Frankenstein.\"<br/>\n\"Wild Billy's Circus\" was inspired by him seeing the Clyde, Beatty Cole Bros. Circus as a child in Freehold and he was curious what went on the in the back alleys of the circus, where you couldn't go down. He said as a kid going to Asbury Park from Freehold was like going to Barbados. Asbury Park had rides and a beach and that was impressive to a kid from Freehold.<br/>\n\"Incident on 57th Street\" Bruce said was also written in Bradley Beach and that the song \"romanticized his visions of New York City.\" He would go to the city just to get out of Freehold. That he and Steve Van Zandt would take the bus from Freehold to Greenwich Village. He mentioned Fourth Street, Bleecker Street and MacDougal Street.<br/>\nA funny story was when Bruce talked about skipping his high school graduation in 1967. He said he decided earlier in the day he wouldn't go to graduation or the party his parents were having with his relatives. He took a bus into Greenwich Village and somehow his parents track him down there. They told him to come home and everything would be OK. \"It wasn't\" Bruce said. He said he brought home a girl he met in the Village and that didn't go over well. Later his father sent him to his room and took out all the light bulbs so he had to sit in the dark. \"That was my graduation day\" Bruce said.<br/>\nBruce said when they were in San Francisco at the Matrix in early 1970, he was peeing next to a guy and at the urinal the guy asked him where are you from? Bruce said, \"New Jersey\" and the guy said, \"What's that?\" \"He didn't ask, 'Where's that?'\" Bruce said. Bruce said he has never dealt with self doubt. When \"Greetings\" sold 23,000 copies, he was thrilled and wanted to know \"Who are all these people buying it! I thought it was great.\"<br/>\nOne of the earlier speakers was Luis Lahav who was the engineer for \"The Wild &amp; Innocent.\" Bruce gave him a shout out (Luis was sitting in the audience) and said \"That record sounds great to this day. I put it in and played it today.\" Bruce summed it up by saying the album was where he \"Finally was getting to express myself.\"<br/>\nBruce was then on the next panel with David Sancious, Vini Lopez and Garry Tallent about the making of the album. Tom Cunningham did a great job of moderating this. It was a real privilege to hear and witness this. I wrote enough already but it was just so great to hear all four of them reminisce of the making of the album at 914 Studios in Blauvelt, New York.<br/>\nThere were plenty of mentions about Clarence Clemons and Danny Federici too with some funny stories throughout the day. In an earlier panel, Vini Lopez talked about what it was like for Bruce and the band when they opened and then backed Chuck Berry at a show at the University of Maryland in 1973. Vini said how then Johnny Lyon (now better known as Southside Johnny) made the trip with them and Chuck brought him up onstage to play harmonica. Vini also told stories about what it was like opening for Chicago for a six-show stretch in 1973 including two shows at Madison Square Garden. \"Chicago flew from town to town, we drove,\" he said. \"We had 30 minutes to play each night, at the first Madison Square Garden show we played an encore, the second night they didn't let us.\"<br/>\nIf I wrote about every panel, this would be longer than \"War and Peace.\"<br/>\nWe heard from Mike Appel, his brother Steve (who had hysterical stories), saw a video interview with Suki Lahav from Israel, heard from Nicki Germaine about her great book as well as Barry Schneier and Jim Cullen about their books, Danny Clinch hosted a panel with Russ Ceccola, brother of the late photographer Phil Ceccola, who shared some never before photos from his brother. Barry Schneier was also a part of the panel.<br/>\nAlso Albee Tellone (the Kevin Buell of his day) and Richie Blackwell shared stories.<br/>\nThe Symposium began with Monmouth U Professor Melissa Kozlowski Ziobro about this being 50 years later and Jim Cullen, Anthony DeCurtis and Louis Masur discussed what it was like in America in 1973. Next up was a \"Setting the Scene\" panel with author Peter Knobler, historian Ken Viola and Vini Lopez moderated by Rolling Stone's Brian Hiatt. Peter and Vini shared stories about when Bruce and the band played Sing Sing Prison in New York in 1972. Vini had a funny line at the end of this panel saying after the Wild &amp; Innocent that the band was finally able to get out of Asbury Park and Freehold and get to Schenectady.<br/>\nThe day closed with great musical performances including Williams Honor, Pat Roddy, Adam Weiner of Low Cut Connie playing \"Incident on 57th Street\" and for me, the musical highlight was listening to David Sancious play the piano intro to \"New York City Serenade\" joined by Pat Guadagno, Richie Blackwell and Vini Lopez.<br/>\nIt was an incredible day at Monmouth University. There were so many other great stories from all the panelist that I didn't even mention.<br/>\nThe event was professionally filmed, so someday hopefully all will be able to see this.<br/>\nThank you to Bob Santelli and Eileen Chapman and whomever else deserves credit for this. Everyone who was there will remember this for a long time. Even though this wasn't a Bruce Springsteen show, it's an event we will be bragging about for years that \"We were there!\"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 10%\">Laura Casale</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid silver; width: 90%\">Hearing Bruce talk about my favorite song in the world (Incident on 57th Street), watching David Sancious play New York City Serenade in front of me and getting to meet him\u2026what a peak life experience!

During the song, he saw a small sign for \"Sherry Darling.\" He asked the woman for the sign but as she moved up to give it to him, she dropped the sign in the gap between the railing and the stage extension. When \"Hungry Heart\" ended Bruce, as my friend said, \"<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/1591656745/videos/pcb.7816048968445246/356547917383611\" target=\"_blank\">went vertical</a>\" and started leaning way down to try to get the sign. He gave my friend Barbara his microphone to hold. Nobody, except those right there, had any idea what he was doing. Nils ran down to hold onto Bruce's foot and security guard Tony almost ran up to help. Bruce finally got the sign and then held it up for all to see. That's something I've never seen at a Bruce show, and the tech did get the microphone back from Barbara.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Pit queue was insane, we got our numbers at 8am and were around 640, it ended up over 1000. We got about 6 rows from the barrier, which felt about right considering the pit numbers around us. To say we were packed like sardines would be an understatement, think that is why there was spare space towards the back of the pit. I was with a group of long Bruce buddies and we had a fab time catching up, lots of reminiscing of course, which always helps time pass. Went into complete meltdown on numerous occasions, the emotion in the crowd was really high. Show this time around was amazing, Bruce on top form and the band, personally thought Better Days was a bit raw. Priest was likely to be played as had been fully soundchecked/rehearsed the day before, thank good ness there were some signs to make it was played. As always, left completely drained having fully emptied the tank. Totally in bits earlier when I YouTubed Priest. This show is going to take a while to recover from.

The setlist was as good as I feel like I could have hoped for at this moment\u2014a true rarity/debut, a ton of great classic songs, and almost everything outside the every-nighters was an exciting choice (though I'm pretty over Spirit). Now in terms of the \"elephant in the room\"\u2014his recovery\u2014I thought everything was really impressive performance-wise. His voice was definitely not perfect but it usually isn't these days (was it ever, ha ha, but you know what I mean); I think we're pretty much at the new normal which is a great sign. A (seemingly) good balance of pushing himself (Something, Downbound, USA) and playing it smart (the Ghosts chorus, he had the crowd sing the USA chorus quite a number of times, etc.) I did feel, at times, that you could see him \"thinking about it\" in terms of motions and performance\u2014totally understandable obviously but something of a small shift from the Bruce of the past who could fully make it seem like he was doing his (carefully orchestrated) performance out of pure in-the-moment instinct. This was my first show since Newark last year, so I was mostly blown away and delighted by how much better the show was than anything I saw in 2023; really night and day in terms of inspiration, present-ness, and \"it factor.\" But how it compares to 2024 pre-cancellations, I can't say. Some other notes: -crowd was roaring and great\u2026. except in my section (123), where they were totally dead! Only stood for Hungry Heart until Because The Night from which point they mostly stayed up (except\u2026 Thunder Road??) I've seen Bruce in England, Ireland, and Northern Ireland but never on the continent before so I was curious to see the famous \"European fans.\" Definitely lots of jumping and \"singing along\" to instrumental parts as promised, but I was pretty amused to be in a section that was literally not on their feet for Thunder Road! People went CRAZY for Born In The USA though\u2014I really see why he plays it over there. -Something In The Night was a strange but fairly effective opener\u2014Roy sounded awesome on it and though Bruce's vocals weren't totally spot-on it was really cool to see the song given such a spotlight moment with a receptive audience to embrace it. So much Darkness tonight was a blast. -Power of Prayer was a liiittle muddy (soundwise too) but still seemed damn good to me\u2014I think it's a fun song and completely worthy of getting played here and there! Really glad to catch it. Absolutely the highlight for me as somebody who loves nothing more than hearing Bruce do something I've never heard him do. -Racing is just so, so good and sounded fabulous in that spot. Bruce is singing this so well this tour for the first time in ages. Wonderful long outro with some slightly different to my ears improvisations by Roy. (If he had to take a vocal-break song last year, why not this every night instead of Kitty! Haha.) -I've been a pretty big supporter of Nightshift and the arrangement is still developing nicely (a real Ada spotlight before the Curtis section these days) but in the stadium context this far into the tour it just doesn't really work. Time to let it go I think. -Downbound Train was really hot and jammed out at the end, felt like it went on really long (in a good way)\u2014SO great to have a little surprise in that dreadful (sorry) stretch of setlist. -Bruce played a lot of guitar tonight although his work wasn't thaaat impressive IMO (probably just due to the hand issues)\u2014as throughout this year, lots of reliance long bendy notes and a little sloppiness actually keeping up with melodic playing (listen to Candy when the Nugs comes out and you'll see what I mean). But he made it work, including really spotlighting Steve on the Prove It outro duel and during Downbound Train. -There was a little call-and-response improvisation in the middle of Glory Days that I don't remember hearing before\u2014just a little wordless vocal line but kind of neat. -I really like Tenth Avenue in these big stadiums because he doesn't do the lap around the pit\u2014feels more like a \"real song\" being performed and works better for it IMO. -As at recent shows, big extended \"who wants to go home\" bit during Twist And Shout. It was a cute one, he ad-libbed \"you did write that song\u2026\" and cracked Steve up and then he had Max say he didn't want to go home in Spanish (it seemed like he kind of butchered it but I don't speak Spanish so I don't know, LOL!) But (and this is a tiny complaint) I never really like it when he does that bit so late it the show; it feels kind of weird to me to make such a big deal out of \"do you think you can outlast the E Street Band\" and then have them be done after two more minutes of Twist And Shout reprises! I think it's a cooler bit earlier in the encore (Glory Days, etc). -Some little moments: Nice moment with the harmonica kid during Promised Land; I think it was during Spirit (or maybe Ghosts?) some guy in the front row basically bear hugged Bruce's legs and held him captive for a couple minutes (it was sweet/funny, not creepy). Bruce screwed up a lyric/sort of tripped over his words at one point in Thunder Road, everyone on stage was cracking up. Bruce ended a song during the encore (I think Twist?) with a Townshend-style guitar-swing; seemed spur-of-the-moment as you could see him quickly gesture Steve to move further out of the way so he'd have room!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

From a setlist perspective, I much preferred night two\u2014the opening stretch tonight absolutely killed but the show was missing both a true rarity and a true (extra) masterpiece like Power Of Prayer and Racing respectively, which for me are two really key elements that take a show to the next level. Having said that, in every other way, tonight was much, much better than Friday. Most important, Bruce's vocals have FULLY recovered\u2014he sounded absolutely years younger than the previous show, it felt extraordinary to me. Similarly, his movement (while obviously there wasn't a ton of it) felt way less ginger and more natural, and his guitar playing was much more precise. It also felt to me like he was playing more to the whole room (rather than just the pit), and speaking of the crowd, it seemed more energetic and more engaged than Friday as well (not, once again, in Section 123, which was a total dud!). Other notes: -Bruce did all the guitar on Cover Me (rather than Nils) and sounded excellent. The horns were really good on this one I thought, often punctuating the arrangement rather than only reproducing the main riff. The backing singers worked great as well. -Crowd was super into Trapped/Ghosts, the momentum there was great. Bruce leaned into everyone clapping along towards the end of Ghosts in a way I haven't seen at other shows. -Steve took the end solo on Prove It, as has been noted; on Friday, it was kind of a pseudo-duel thing with Bruce playing as well (and seemed to be a surprise to Steven); here, it was a traditional solo and sounded good to me though I love Bruce on that song. -Hate what the horns do to Atlantic City\u2014one of their very worst songs. -I really don't get/like having the audience sing part of the opening verses of The River; it just doesn't make sense to me for the song and seems way off tonally. Crowd eats it up though. -During Last Man Standing, the subtitles accidentally had one line of the song in French! -I love I'm On Fire and it's so great to have a wildcard slot in that part of the set, but I have to say I didn't really like the performance. He did it in his kind of jaunty campfire singalong style (think the slow dance-walk from Thunder Road/Tenth Avenue, but in place)\u2014undercut the intensity IMO. -Twist And Shout \"I don't want to go home\" bit was effectively rewritten, with Bruce and Steve hamming it up looking out at the crowd and pointing out that after \"three nights, nine hours,\" we looked tired! There was also a (quite brief) La Bamba interlude for the first time on the tour (after sort of semi-teasing it on Friday). Came home to the hotel tired and happy.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Bruce's voice was quite a bit worse than Madrid 3 although definitely still better than Madrid 2, and the setlist was worse than either (of course part of that is my fault for seeing so many shows close together\u2014but even a lot of the wildcard choices were pretty rough going tonight.) Still, plenty of highlights and a very good time. Bruce seemed in a good mood (lots of dancing, joking around with the pit) although things got a little rushed-feeling towards the back end until the great extra encore. Max was absolutely unbelievable tonight\u2014he always is but that opening run was absolutely punishing and he just killed it. I'll add that despite the vocal troubles he actually sounded great in the falsetto range\u2014the ending to The River was breathtaking but he always went \"up\" during Cover Me, Nightshift, and a couple other places to great effect. Song notes: -Cover Me sounded really good again, especially Bruce's opening guitar bit\u2014I wouldn't be surprised to see this one get rotated in pretty regularly going forward. -Radio Nowhere was rough rough rough\u2014some of his worst vocals of the night and a couple moments where the band really wasn't quite together rounding the turns. Good to hear a latter-day debut but I don't think the song won any new fans tonight. Steve sounded great on it though. -Crowd was VERY into Ghosts from the start, lots of clapping from the very beginning. (In general I noticed the Barcelona fans liked to start clapping along especially during the last part of songs\u2014at times a little distractingly! -Darkness is such an incredible song\u2014in a way one of his most underrated I think. It should really be on every Best Of compilation, and is the far greater song IMO than Promised Land despite getting played so occasionally in recent years (decades?). Luckily his voice came through for it. -Power Of Prayer sounded a lot smoother, vocally and otherwise, than the debut\u2014I'd much rather hear Priest or Janey obviously but this is a lot better than Letter To You in the slot. Bruce dedicated it to \"the t-shirt people\" (there were a ton of fans in the front of the pit wearing matching t-shirts, not sure what was going on). -Sunny Day is just so awful\u2014it's a dreadful song made much, much worse live. The most annoying thing in the catalogue. Worse still, he did the kiddy-karaoke bit tonight too (although the kid seemed sufficiently unprepared that it was cut mercifully short). I really think I'd rather him just play one fewer song. -When the Nugs comes out, give Backstreets from this show a listen\u2014at the end of the spoken section he kind of fell into a revery, very moving, did a couple extra repetitions but changing the lyric to \"until it ends.\" Reminded me of the speech from Kilkenny '13\u2014the older you get the more it means. Then he did a rather lengthy wordless vocal improvisation before jumping back into the song. -Maybe my imagination but I'm pretty sure She's The One was played notably faster than usual\u2014kind of gave it some new energy but maybe a little less note-perfect than usual as a result. There was also an issue where Jake's sound wasn't working at the start of his solo. -Do Europeans not care about Thunder Road or what? Have been amazed how many people sat for it all three shows. I can really see why he plays Born In The USA here though; got a way bigger response than anything else again. -Rockin' was a wonderful surprise and not a rush-job at all\u2014felt like a \"true encore\" which is the absolute perfect place for that song, I don't like it at all in the main set but it's a perfect rock and roll dessert.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

There's no getting around that the setlist was something of a disappointment\u2014just one song that hasn't been played already on this Spanish run, only 7 songs not played at the first Barcelona show (after 11 changes night to night between both Madrid shows), and at least a couple pretty dreadful selections (Sunny Day is really an embarrassment). Atlantic City, Reason To Believe, and Racing are all amazing choices of course and that made a big difference, but still something of a letdown even without knowing about the soundcheck (maybe prep for a Patti appearance that didn't happen?) With that out of the way, I'll say that the performance was CLEARLY stronger than night 1 in my book, with Bruce's voice in particular a night and day improvement. (People who gave me shit for criticizing his voice on Radio Nowhere last show should really compare the two performances\u2014the difference is ENORMOUS.) Bruce seemed in a good mood and the band was really tight throughout, a well-oiled machine with no real fuck-ups to mention (actually I do think Bruce got slightly ahead of the band at one moment in Glory Days but that was tiny). One oddity is that Bruce played barely any lead guitar all night after the opener. Then there's the personal element\u2014this was my first show of the tour in the pit (for a combination of cost and co-attendee reasons) and it really does make just such a huge difference. Not just the infinitely better sight of the stage but being among the most engaged\u2014enthusiasm is contagious of course and it was a great experience. (Line getting in was pretty impressive\u2014I arrived at 6 and was quite a ways back within the pit.) The crowd was excellent and intense and joyous (not sure about in the seats of course). That said, although there are definitely cultural differences (the jumping, the singing along to the melodies, a lot more shoulder-sitting in the encores), it seems to me the generalizations about European fans being better seem somewhat overstated to me. Really an amazing trip, first of all to Spain where I'd never been before but also for these four Bruce shows which I enjoyed immensely.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Nor was it the 55,000 people who are just really quiet, when Bruce asks for it (wow, that was beautiful). No, the story of Odense took place not far behind me. A woman, around 70 years old, stood there full of emotion. Not a happy emotion, when looking into Ella's bloodred eyes. I soon noticed why, as she held a sign; \"Bruce, my husband died last Friday, please play Tougher then the Rest.\" That really hits. Just before the start of \"Nightshift\" we brought this woman forward. There she stood, at the rail. Then came \"Last Man Standing\". The old woman broke down. Everyone around her broke as well. Within 20 minutes of not knowing each other, we cried with her. Me, too. We all hugged her, after which the old woman walked back to her own place on the field. Grateful for the support she had just received. Bruce unites!</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

When I took my seat there were 2 reserved seats next to me and for a moment I thought \"Could this be real?\", but then I saw the reserved seats with no names on them in the next section and thought \"Oh, that's where he's going to be\" and it was. I was ready for his entrance, but still thrilled when he entered. I was facing straight to the screen and Bruce was on the side a bit, so I had a clear view of him, Stevie, Jon, Pam and group. Very cool! Once the movie started though, I was enraptured. Sure, I knew a lot of this stuff and had seen some of the interviews already, but Thom Zimny did a wonderful job of putting it all together. It flowed very well from the beginning of Bruce's career and performances to present day. The story telling surrounding the songs in the set list was great. Everyone interviewed, especially the E Street Band members, were honest and open with their comments. I was choked up during the segment about Clarence and Danny. Shocked and saddened when Patti talked about her multiple myeloma cancer diagnosis. You could hear gasps throughout the hall. I wanted to look over to see Bruce's reaction, but controlled myself. It felt like watching a concert at some points. I sang and clapped. I may have even raised my fist a few times! LOL I'm glad that I was able to watch it on the big screen. The Q&amp;A after was okay. Again, nothing really surprising and Bruce only spoke for a short bit, but what he said had great impact, was emotional and connected with me and I'm sure everyone else regarding friendship and aging. It's a shame that many people won't see the movie without spoilers, especially Patti's diagnosis, as some parts are quite moving and you lose a bit when you know what is about to happen.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

When the greatest shows in the history of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band are discussed, the Sept. 15, 2024 show in Asbury Park is going to be right on top or near the top of that list. Just an incredible evening, it was surreal. There were cheers, tears and just amazement by the 35,000 people in attendance who witnessed a legendary performance. Bruce earlier in the afternoon joined the Trey Anastasio Band for \"Kitty's Back\" then he traveled over to another stage to join the Gaslight Anthem for two songs, \"History Book\" and American Slang. Then it was time for the main event of the festival. Bruce and the band took the stage at 7:32 p.m. \"Greetings Asbury Park,\" Bruce said.<br/>\n1. Lonesome Day<br/>\n2. Blinded By The Light (tour premiere)<br/>\nBruce before playing \"Blinded\" said: \"I wrote this song about 500 yards north on Loch Arbour beach. We haven't played it in a long Fuckin' time. There's a lot of stuff we haven't played in a long fuckin' time. Let's see how we do?\"<br/>\n3. Does This Bus Stop at 82nd Street (tour premiere)<br/>\n4. Growin' Up<br/>\nThe story in the middle: \"There I was, driving down Kingsley. Streets were empty. Buildings all shut down. Nobody on Cookman Avenue, nobody on Main Street, nobody on Ocean Avenue, nobody anywhere. And then I was dreaming, and when I woke up I said, \"Where did all these fuckin' people come from? It's good to see you here! Let's hear it for Asbury Park!\"<br/>\n5. The Promised Land<br/>\n6. Spirit In The Night<br/>\nBruce before Spirit: \"I feel the moon shinin'! (It was almost a full moon out). I need an Asbury Park howl!\"<br/>\n7. Thundercrack (tour premiere)<br/>\nJewishjulie Sokol Chaz's favorite song. \"I wrote this song when I was 20 up at the surfboard factory in Wanamassa.\"<br/>\n8. The E Street Shuffle<br/>\n9. 4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy) (tour premiere)<br/>\n\"I want to dedicate this in the memory of Danny Federici tonight,\" Bruce said. Couldn't be a more perfect song for a beautiful evening in Asbury Park.<br/>\n10. Hungry Heart<br/>\n11. Local Hero<br/>\n\"I was driving through Freehold. At the time there was still a J.J. Newberry's. That's how much people remember J.J. Newberry's! It was a five and 10 cents store. You remember five and 10 cents stores? I'm driving down Main Street, I look in the window and I see this black velvet painting of a Doberman Pinscher. And I look on the other side, and I see this black velvet painting of Bruce Lee. And I look in the middle, and I see a black velvet painting of myself with the headband and the muscles and I went home and wrote this song.\" Great version, love the horns throughout and especially at the end.<br/>\n12. Atlantic City<br/>\n13. Tougher Than The Rest<br/>\nBruce brought Patti Scialfa out for this. Well done.<br/>\n14. Long Walk Home<br/>\n\"This is a prayer for our country.\"<br/>\n15. Racing In The Street<br/>\nRoy Bittan continues to be the best.<br/>\n16. Because The Night<br/>\n17. She's The One<br/>\n18. Wrecking Ball<br/>\n19. The Rising<br/>\n20. Badlands<br/>\n21. Thunder Road<br/>\nEncores: \"Wow! I'm feeling f** old tonight but in a good way! The band, we were here on that little street corner when nobody was here. I didn't know if I would see folks in this good town again. I just want to take a moment to thank all the people that have invested themselves in Asbury Park and brought the city back. From the East Side to the West Side. I want to thank the LBGTQ-plus community for all they do. Danny Clinch, I want to thank you. Most of all I want to thank all of you for being here tonight.\".<br/>\n22. Meeting Across The River (tour premiere)<br/>\nMy favorite Springsteen song. My phone lit up with Facebook messages and texts from friends. I looked at Alexandra Jardvall, who I was watching the show with, and the tears started to flow. Curt Ramm's trumpet is so beautiful here. \"Change your shirt, tonight, we got style.\" And you knew what was coming next:<br/>\n23. Jungleland<br/>\n24. Born to Run<br/>\n25. Rosalita<br/>\n26. Bobby Jean<br/>\n27. Dancin' In The Dark<br/>\n28. Tenth Avenue Freeze Out<br/>\n29. Twist and Shout<br/>\nBruce said: \"Some of you have been out here since 8 a.m.! 4 a.m.!\"<br/>\n30. Jersey Girl<br/>\nShow over at 10:45 p.m. for a 3:13 show.<br/>\nThe perfect song to top off a perfect night. A night of pure magic on the beach at Asbury Park. It was a bit windy and got cooler as the night progressed. As Dudley Moore said, when asked to rate Bo Derek in the movie \"10\" on a scale of 1-10, he said \"An 11.\" This show was an 11.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"

Somebody other guy must must have shot the lion.\u2019\u201d<br/>\n1. Power of Prayer; Played for only the fourth time. Twice at shows this year in Spain, and for the second time at this benefit.<br/>\nBruce joke: \"Wife is going to do a real nice thing for her husband on his birthday. I think I'm going to take him to a strip club. They go to the front door and the bouncer says, 'Dave, how you doing?' Honey, how does he remember your name? Oh, he's in my bowling league. Every Tuesday. They go in the club, sit down, waitress comes up drops a Budweiser in front of him and says, 'Do you want your usual Dave?' She says, 'Honey, how does that woman know what you like to drink? Oh, she's in the ladies auxiliary of the bowling league. We share the lanes right next to each other. A line of strippers comes out. A stripper comes down and sits on his lap. \"Dave, do you want your table dance?' Wife has had enough, she is outside, she is in the taxi. Dave is running his ass after her. He gets in the taxi, she is giving him everything in the book, she is holding nothing back. The taxi driver turns around and says 'Geez, that's some bitch you picked up tonight!'\"<br/>\n2. Land of Hope and Dreams<br/>\nBruce joke: \"Bakery burns down. Business is toast.\"<br/>\n3. Dancing in the Dark; Bruce had fun with the crowd on this, on \"You sit around gettin' older\" and \"I need a love reaction.\"<br/>\nBruce joke: \"Guy goes into the library. Says to the librarian, 'Where do you keep your books on paranoia?' (in a creep voice), \"Right behind you.\"<br/>\n4.

He spoke out against the horrifying political situation in the U.S., where human dignity is trampled daily by a sadistic administration that thrives on fear and division. This isn't just a political crisis, it's a democratic emergency. Autocracy is creeping into the White House. Citizens are being turned against each other with orchestrated lies. Long-standing alliances are being insulted, abandoned, and replaced by threats. This isn't just about (US)America. It's about all of us. We don't currently have the privilege to be non-political!

He joined Jeremy Allen White, Jennifer Lawrence and Tessa Thompson.<br/>\nHe wore a waistcoat over a grey shirt with tie, and barely had enough room to sit on his end of the sofa. (He was maybe thinking everyone else on it was young enough to be his kids!)<br/>\nHe had two glasses to drink from, but mostly drank water.<br/>\nBruce joked that he was 10 years old when he recorded \u2018Born To Run\u2019, after Graham noted it was 50 years ago. He confirmed he sang it at every show, adding \u2018that\u2019s what they pay me for\u2019.<br/>\nJennifer Lawrence explained that while making one film she frequently listened to one of Bruce\u2019s songs to get in the right mood. Bruce joked that \u2018Nebraska\u2019 wouldn\u2019t have helped, and guessed at \u2018Waitin\u2019 On A Sunny Day\u2019, before it was revealed to be \u2018Santa Claus Is Comin\u2019 To Town\u2019.<br/>\nTessa Thompson mentioned that her father went on tour with Bruce \u2013 Marc Anthony Thompson from The Seeger Sessions Band. She recalled coming to one of the 2006 shows, hoisted onto someone\u2019s shoulders to see.<br/>\nJeremy Allen White described how Bruce was involved, how they met at Wembley 2024, and including his visits to the set. Bruce admitted he felt guilty about his \u2018stupid ass\u2019 being present, putting pressure on Jeremy. \u2018That\u2019s awful - have you apologised?\u2019 quipped Jennifer. He had been invited by the director Scott, but suggested he was in two minds about being there. Jeremy said that as Bruce was there so often it became normal for him to have him around. Bruce avoided giving notes mostly, just occasionally advising Scott on the tone of things at times. Asked how it was to see himself portrayed, Bruce initially avoided any reference to the dark part of the story, just repeating his comment that he couldn\u2019t believe (watching Jeremy) that he was ever \u2018that young and that good looking\u2019.<br/>\nGraham asked Bruce if he had to approve the casting of Jeremy, and he said not, but that when Scott told him Jeremy was the choice, he had been the only actor Bruce thought about for the role, as a fan of \u2018The Bear\u2019 and how \u2018psychological\u2019 an actor he was. He then briefly mentioned \u2018personal struggles\u2019 being a focus of the biopic, adding that of course he hadn\u2019t been sharing at the time how he was \u2018losing my mind\u2019.<br/>\nBruce described filming the performance of the \u2018Nebraska\u2019 album as part of the upcoming box set as it hadn\u2019t been done like that before. Jeremy explained how he wasn\u2019t a trained singer or guitarist until training for this film. Scott told him that if the singing didn\u2019t feel right, they could find a way round it with blending vocals. Bruce said that Jeremy wasn\u2019t just imitating him, but capturing his \u2018internal life\u2019 authentically. He joked that he was going to be stealing some of Jeremy\u2019s moves.<br/>\nBruce told a story about being given a glass of beer by a fan during a show in Germany which was both larger and much stronger than he was expecting, and having drunk it all quickly he felt \u2018stoned\u2019, and his reaction was that he felt \u2018I sound so fucking good right now!\u2019<br/>\nHe explained how The Castiles were named after a shampoo brand, and the name suited the times when band names were often prefixed with \u2018The \u2026\u2019 Seeing the band\u2019s promo photo, Graham added that they were influenced by The Beatles, and Bruce described the effort it took to get his naturally curly hair straight like that.<br/>\nAsked if he might now feel self-conscious on stage having seen the film, Bruce admitted that Jeremy picked up many of his mannerisms, which he hadn\u2019t been aware of before, but smiled: \u2018I think I\u2019ll be all right\u2019.<br/>\nBruce explained how \u2018Nebraska\u2019 was made accidentally after the success of \u2018The River\u2019 and against expectations, but how despite recording \u2018Born In The USA\u2019 at the same time, he felt the quieter album was the right choice at the time; and of course \u2018Born In The USA\u2019 succeeded later anyway.<br/>\nAfter Jeremy described dealing with the attention of young female fans, Bruce joked that he didn\u2019t have that problem as his fans are all aged about 70 now!<br/>\nJennifer and Tessa compared experiences of struggling with costumes not designed to let them pee, and having to use a funnel\u2026 Graham asked Bruce if he had used a funnel, and Jennifer said he was \u2018born with a funnel\u2019!<br/>\nBruce told the story about getting the title of \u2018Born In The USA\u2019 from Paul Schrader\u2019s script, and giving him \u2018Light Of Day\u2019 instead. He added he found it hard to believe that it was proposed to cast him opposite Robert De Niro, saying they\u2019d never talked about it.<br/>\nFlorence joined the sofa after two live band performances of her new song \u2018Everybody Scream\u2019, and joked how she only ever met Bruce on the show, having done so previously. She admitted that she was a fan of his music and had performed \u2018I\u2019m Goin\u2019 Down\u2019 as a duet long ago but been too shy to tell him last time. Bruce said he was flattered at what he called an unusual choice for a duet being covered. Somebody said that next time they met on the show, Bruce and Florence should do the song together (to applause from the audience).<br/>\nThere was a fun moment when Florence and Tessa hugged on the sofa, so not to be outdone, Jennifer then hugged Tessa, and Jeremy hugged Bruce!<br/>\nThe first guest in the Big Red Chair was Carmen, obviously a Bruce fan, who told a story about seeing someone wearing a \u2018Bruce Crew\u2019 t-shirt and assuming they were also a Springsteen fan, but then learned from the guy that his name was Bruce and his staff were his \u2018crew\u2019 \u2013 she got ejected from the chair.<br/>\nBruce got \u2018Broooced\u2019 again as he left, of course. Graham said he thought Jennifer and Tessa hadn\u2019t experienced that reaction before and were probably a bit confused about it.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>"
