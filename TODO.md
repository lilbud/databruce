<!-- Position Stats?
        Taken from LTTMP by Justin Mason
        Note for when a song is Show/Set Opener or Closer a number of times
        LTTMP seems to cut off at 9 times, could probably go with no cap
        `[X] NUM/MAX of times as [Position]`
            OR
        `[X] Only Time as [Position]` -->

Song Gaps:
mark only time played as song with only one public play
find better way to mark gaps
dripfield/elgoose for inspiration?
not sure how LTTMP or JB does it but will check
